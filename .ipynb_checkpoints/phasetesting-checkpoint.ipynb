      "Individual differences in serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptor may result in variable response to antipsychotics with 5-HT1A receptor partial agonism. We investigated the relationship between 5-HT1A receptor gene (HTR1A) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and efficacy of antipsychotics with 5-HT1A receptor partial agonism in Japanese patients with schizophrenia. Perospirone or aripiprazole was administered to 100 patients with schizophrenia in a randomized controlled study. Candidate SNPs were rs6295 (which affects HTR1A expression and function), rs1364043, rs878567, and rs10042486. Efficacy at week 12 of treatment was evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) 5-factor subscales (excitement/hostility, depression/anxiety, cognition, positive, and negative). Rs1364043 T allele was correlated with the percent change in the PANSS 5-factor negative score (P < 0.01). Haplotype analysis showed that the rs10042486-rs6295-rs1364043 T-C-G haplotype was correlated with worse negative score improvement (haplotype frequency, 0.675; P = 0.014), and the relatively rare T-G-T haplotype correlated with better efficacy (haplotype frequency, 0.05; P = 0.031). This is the first study to show that rs10042486-rs6295-rs1364043 HTR1A variants may be correlated with the improvement of the PANSS 5-factor negative score during treatment with 5-HT1A partial agonist antipsychotics.

      "Few data are available on the efficacy and safety of antipsychotics with different dopamine D2 receptor (D2-R)-binding properties in drug-na√Øve and non-drug-na√Øve schizophrenia. Thus, we aimed to assess whether antipsychotic medication history influences efficacy and tolerability in schizophrenia, based on a randomized controlled study of antipsychotics with mechanisms involving either full antagonism or partial agonism of D2-R. Patients with schizophrenia were recruited and given perospirone or aripiprazole in a 12-week, flexible-dose, open-label, randomized controlled study. Data were analyzed after dividing the patients into antipsychotic-na√Øve and antipsychotic-treated group according to antipsychotic medication histories. Efficacy and safety were evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale, and the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale. In patients receiving perospirone, the antipsychotic-na√Øve group (n = 22) showed greater symptom improvement than that shown by the antipsychotic-treated group (n = 29), as assessed by efficacy evaluation scales such as the PANSS total, positive, and excited component score (p = .006, p < .001, p = .003, respectively). In patients receiving aripiprazole, however, there was no significant difference in efficacy between the antipsychotic-na√Øve (n = 18) and antipsychotic-treated (n = 31) groups. No significant intra-group or inter-group difference was noted with respect to any of the tolerability-related parameters assessed. The present study data support the hypothesis that antipsychotic medication history may influence efficacy in patients who receive a D2-R full antagonist but not a D2-R partial agonist.['Adult', 'Aged', 'Akathisia, Drug-Induced / etiology', 'Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use*', 'Aripiprazole / therapeutic use*', 'Basal Ganglia Diseases / chemically induced', 'Dopamine Agonists / therapeutic use*', 'Dopamine D2 Receptor Antagonists / therapeutic use*', 'Drug Partial Agonism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Isoindoles / therapeutic use*', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Dopamine D2 / agonists', 'Schizophrenia / drug therapy*', 'Schizophrenic Psychology*', 'Thiazoles / therapeutic use*', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "In previous studies, we demonstrated that tandospirone, a serotonin-5-HT1A partial agonist, added to ongoing treatment with small to moderate doses of typical antipsychotic drugs, improved executive function and verbal learning and memory. However, tandospirone is not available in most countries, and atypical antipsychotic drugs (AAPDs) have largely replaced typical antipsychotic drugs as the primary treatment for schizophrenia. Therefore, the goal of this randomly assigned placebo-controlled double-blind study was to determine if the addition of buspirone, a widely available 5-HT1A partial agonist, would enhance cognitive function, in subjects with schizophrenia treated with AAPDs. Seventy-three patients with schizophrenia, who had been treated with an AAPD for at least three months, were randomly assigned to receive either buspirone, 30 mg/day, or matching placebo. All other medications remained unchanged. Attention, verbal fluency, verbal learning and memory, verbal working memory, and executive function, as well as psychopathology, were assessed at baseline, and 6 weeks, and 3 and 6 months after baseline. A significant Time x Group interaction effect was noted on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, a measure of attention/speeded motor performance, due to better performance of the buspirone group compared to the placebo group at 3 months. No significant interaction effects were noted for other domains of cognition. Scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (Total, Positive) were improved during treatment with buspirone but not placebo, but the effects did not reach statistical significance. The results of this study showed a possible benefit of buspirone augmentation of AAPDs to enhance attention. However, we did not replicate the results of the previous study with tandospirone, which may be due to the differences between tandospirone and buspirone, between typical antipsychotics and AAPDs, or a combination of the above. Further study to determine the usefulness of 5-HT1A agonist treatment in schizophrenia is indicated.['Adult', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use', 'Buspirone / therapeutic use*', 'Cognition Disorders / diagnosis', 'Cognition Disorders / drug therapy*', 'Cognition Disorders / psychology', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Isoindoles', 'Male', 'Neuropsychological Tests / statistics & numerical data', 'Piperazines / therapeutic use', 'Placebos', 'Pyrimidines / therapeutic use', 'Schizophrenia / diagnosis', 'Schizophrenia / drug therapy*', 'Schizophrenic Psychology*', 'Serotonin Receptor Agonists / therapeutic use*', 'Treatment Outcome']Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

The effect of AQW051 on task-related (EMT and WMT) brain activation and performance was also assessed, as were safety and tolerability.\n",
      "Overall, 60 of 68 enrolled participants completed the study (AQW051 then placebo: 7.5mg n=9; 50mg n=11; 100mg n=10. Placebo then AQW051: 7.5mg n=10; 50mg n=11; 100mg n=9). Significant task-related brain activation (5% significance level) was observed with placebo. During the WMT, a medium effect size was observed in the inferior prefrontal cortex with AQW051 100mg versus placebo (0.431; p=0.105). During the EMT encoding phase, a large effect size was observed in the anterior hippocampus (0.795; p=0.007) and a medium effect size in the posterior hippocampus (0.476; p=0.079) with AQW051 7.5mg. No other medium/large effect sizes were observed with any dose on either task. Effects on brain activation were generally not associated with changes in cognitive performance. AQW051 was well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile.\n",
      "Overall, no consistent effects of AQW051 on brain regions involved in the performance of a WMT or EMT were observed; however, this study presents a model for evaluating potential response to pharmacological interventions for cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Azabicyclo Compounds / therapeutic use*', 'Brain / blood supply', 'Brain / diagnostic imaging*', 'Brain / drug effects', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging*', 'Male', 'Memory Disorders / drug therapy', 'Memory Disorders / etiology', 'Memory, Episodic', 'Memory, Short-Term / drug effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Nicotinic Agonists / therapeutic use*', 'Oxygen / blood', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Pyridines / therapeutic use*', 'Receptors, Nicotinic', 'Schizophrenia / complications', 'Schizophrenia / diagnostic imaging*', 'Schizophrenia / drug therapy*', 'Young Adult']Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "In an ongoing effort to characterize the clinical pharmacologic profile of the partial dopamine agonist (-)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-n-propylpiperidine [(-)-3PPP], we administered it to drug-free schizophrenic patients in two consecutive studies.\n",
      "In a preliminary dose-finding study, 9 patients were treated using a 6-week placebo-controlled crossover design. Then, to properly demonstrate the antipsychotic effect, we carried out an early efficacy study; here 10 patients received (-)-3PPP, 300 mg B.I.D., in a 1-week placebo-controlled crossover study.\n",
      "Dose-Finding Study: (-)-3PPP showed apparent antipsychotic effect in repeated dosing, with 300 mg B.I.D. being the most effective dose for antipsychotic action; however, the apparent antipsychotic action was not sustained for longer than 1 week, presumably because of desensitization of the receptor by the agonist. Early Efficacy Study: Positive symptoms as measured by the Psychosis Change Scale decreased in 1 week by 30% with (-)-3PPP compared to placebo, and negative symptoms measured with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale Withdrawal subscale decreased by 28% with the drug. In both studies, (-)-3PPP lacked any evidence of motor side effects.\n",
      "These data show that psychotic symptoms decrease with (-)-3PPP and suggest that the treatment of schizophrenia with partial dopamine agonist is a promising strategy.

      "The results of an open tolerability and exploratory efficacy study of bretazenil, a partial benzodiazepine-receptor agonist in hospitalized schizophrenic patients with an acute psychotic episode (DSM-III-R criteria), are presented. The duration of the study was 6 weeks, with a mandatory titration (ascending doses of 3-18 mg/day) period of 14 days. The assessment criteria for tolerability were the frequency of adverse events (including EPS), vital signs and laboratory tests. The efficacy criteria, which were only descriptively analysed, were: (a) Clinical Global Impression (CGI, percentage of \"very much\" and \"much\" improvement); and (b) change in BPRS total score (e.g. percentage of patients showing > or = 40% decrease of BPRS score at the end of the treatment). Sixty-six patients (aged 21-62 years) with acute episodes of schizophrenia of moderate to marked severity (mean BPRS score = 46.3, range 26-76) were included in the study. Of these 66 patients (68%) were reportedly non-responders (n = 10) or partial responders (n = 35) to previous neuroleptic therapy. Twenty patients (30%) terminated the trial prematurely due to therapeutic failure (no improvement or worsening after 2 weeks of treatment), 17% of patients dropped out due to other reasons (transfer to other hospitals, withdrawal of consent, intercurrent diseases) and 4.5% of patients stopped the treatment due to adverse reactions. Four patients (6%) showed early complete remission and refused to be further treated. The analysis of efficacy (intention-to-treat) revealed a sustained decrease of BPRS scores with 49% of patients showing > or = 40% BPRS score change by the end of the treatment. Forty-four per cent of patients improved \"very much\" or \"much\". Eleven patients (17%) were full responders (BPRS score decrease 75-100%) and 21 patients (32%) showed at least 40% reduction of BPRS score. The reduction of BPRS scores in completers only was 60%. All BPRS factor scores decreased in parallel and, particularly, no preferential decrease of anxiety/depression subscores was found. The analysis of tolerability showed that 59% of patients presented no complaints at all. The most frequent treatment-related adverse reactions in the remaining patients were: sedation (n = 14), dizziness (n = 4) and headache (n = 3). The results of this study suggest moderate antipsychotic efficacy of bretazenil in schizophrenic patients. They encourage further investigations of partial benzodiazepine-receptor agonists in this indication, particularly because of the excellent tolerability and lack of extrapyramidal side-effects.['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antipsychotic Agents / administration & dosage*', 'Benzodiazepinones / administration & dosage*', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Receptors, GABA-A / drug effects*', 'Schizophrenia / diagnosis', 'Schizophrenia / drug therapy*', 'Schizophrenic Psychology*', 'Treatment Outcome']Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",
