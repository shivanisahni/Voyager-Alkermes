      "The muscarinic receptor agonist xanomeline improved cognition in phase 2 trials in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. We present data on the effect of KarXT (xanomeline-trospium) on cognition in schizophrenia from the 5-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled EMERGENT-1 trial (NCT03697252). Analyses included 125 patients with computerised Cogstate Brief Battery (CBB) subtest scores at baseline and endpoint. A post hoc subgroup analysis evaluated the effects of KarXT on cognitive performance in patients with or without clinically meaningful cognitive impairment at baseline, and a separate outlier analysis excluded patients with excessive intraindividual variability (IIV) across cognitive subdomains. ANCOVA models assessed treatment effects for completers and impairment subgroups, with or without removal of outliers. Sample-wide, cognitive improvement was numerically but not statistically greater with KarXT (n = 60) than placebo (n = 65), p = 0.16. However, post hoc analyses showed 65 patients did not exhibit clinically meaningful cognitive impairment at baseline, while eight patients had implausibly high IIV at one or both timepoints. Significant treatment effects were observed after removing outliers (KarXT n = 54, placebo n = 63; p = 0.04). Despite the small sample size, a robust (d = 0.50) and significant effect was observed among patients with cognitive impairment (KarXT n = 23, placebo n = 37; p = 0.03).

      "A 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was conducted from August 2012 to March 2014. Subjects with a diagnosis of schizophrenia based on DSM-IV-TR criteria (confirmed by the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview version 6.0.0) were randomized 1:1:1 to ABT-126 25 mg, ABT-126 75 mg, or placebo once daily while maintained on their background antipsychotic medication. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline on the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) neurocognitive composite score; the primary analysis compared ABT-126 with placebo at week 12 using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures. Secondary endpoints included the change from baseline on the University of California San Diego Performance-based Skills Assessment-2 Extended-Range, the 16-item Negative Symptom Assessment scale (NSA-16), and safety assessments.\n",
      "Of the 157 randomized subjects, 82% completed the study. The mean baseline MCCB neurocognitive composite score for the entire study sample was 28.8; scores were similar across groups. No statistical difference in the change from baseline score between any of the ABT-126 dose groups and placebo was observed on the MCCB neurocognitive composite score (ABT-126 25 mg, +0.28; ABT-126 75 mg, +0.41; placebo, +1.42). Differences in the NSA-16 total score were seen with ABT-126 75 mg versus placebo at week 6 (-2.79; P = .011) and week 12 (-1.94; P = .053). Adverse events with ABT-126 were similar to placebo, except for constipation (5.8% for ABT-126 vs 0% for placebo).\n",
      "ABT-126 did not demonstrate a procognitive effect in subjects with stable schizophrenia who smoke. A trend for improvement in negative symptoms was observed with the high dose. The safety profile of ABT-126 was similar to placebo.\n",

      "Encenicline is a novel, selective α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist in development for treating cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. A phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-design, multinational study was conducted. Patients with schizophrenia on chronic stable atypical antipsychotics were randomized to encenicline 0.27 or 0.9 mg once daily or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was the Overall Cognition Index (OCI) score from the CogState computerized battery. Secondary end points include MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) (in US patients), the Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale (SCoRS) total score, SCoRS global rating, and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total and subscale and cognition factor scores. Of 319 randomized patients, 317 were included in the safety population, and 307 were included in the intent-to-treat population. Notable trends in improvement were demonstrated across all cognition scales. For the OCI score, the LS mean difference for encenicline 0.27 mg vs placebo was significant (Cohen's d=0.257; P=0.034). Mean SCoRS total scores decreased showing improvement in function over time, and the difference was significant for encenicline 0.9 mg vs placebo (P=0.011). Furthermore, the difference between encenicline 0.9 mg and placebo was significant for the PANSS Cognition Impairment Domain (P=0.0098, Cohen's d=0.40) and for the PANSS Negative scale (P=0.028, Cohen's d=0.33). Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported at similar frequencies across all treatment groups (39.0% with placebo, 23.4% with encenicline 0.27 mg, and 33.3% with encenicline 0.9 mg). Overall, encenicline was generally well tolerated and demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in cognition and function in patients with schizophrenia.Adolescent Adult Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use Cognition / drug effects Cognition Disorders / drug therapy* Cognition Disorders / physiopathology Double-Blind Method Female Humans Male Middle Aged Nicotinic Agonists / adverse effects Nicotinic Agonists / therapeutic use Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Psychotropic Drugs / adverse effects Psychotropic Drugs / therapeutic use* Quinuclidines / adverse effects Quinuclidines / therapeutic use* Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Schizophrenia / physiopathology Schizophrenic Psychology Thiophenes / adverse effects Thiophenes / therapeutic use* Treatment Outcome Young Adult alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor / agonists* alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor / metabolismQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "A double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 24-week, multicenter trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 3 doses of ABT-126, an α7 nicotinic receptor agonist, for the treatment of cognitive impairment in nonsmoking subjects with schizophrenia. Clinically stable subjects were randomized in 2 stages: placebo, ABT-126 25 mg, 50 mg or 75 mg once daily (stage 1) and placebo or ABT-126 50 mg (stage 2). The primary analysis was the change from baseline to week 12 on the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) neurocognitive composite score for ABT-126 50 mg vs placebo using a mixed-model for repeated-measures. A key secondary measure was the University of California Performance-based Assessment-Extended Range (UPSA-2ER). A total of 432 subjects were randomized and 80% (344/431) completed the study. No statistically significant differences were observed in either the change from baseline for the MCCB neurocognitive composite score (+2.66 [±0.54] for ABT-126 50 mg vs +2.46 [±0.56] for placebo at week 12; P>0.05) or the UPSA-2ER. A trend for improvement was seen at week 24 on the 16-item Negative Symptom Assessment Scale total score for ABT-126 50 mg (change from baseline -4.27±[0.58] vs -3.00±[0.60] for placebo; P=0.059). Other secondary analyses were generally consistent with the primary end point results. Adverse event rates were similar for ABT-126 and placebo. ABT-126 did not demonstrate a consistent effect on cognition in nonsmoking subjects with schizophrenia; however, a trend toward an effect was observed on negative symptoms.

      "Norepinephrine plays a significant role in the working memory functions of the prefrontal cortex by its actions at alpha-2a noradrenergic receptors. Guanfacine has demonstrated efficacy in reversing working memory deficits in non-human primate. In the present study the effect of guanfacine adjunctive treatment to neuroleptics on the cognitive performance of schizophrenic patients was investigated in a four week, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel design trial. The primary analyses revealed no significant differences between guanfacine and placebo treatment; however, exploratory non-parametric statistics revealed some significant and some trend differences between guanfacine and placebo on spatial working memory test performance and CPT reaction time in those subjects treated with atypical neuroleptics.Adrenergic alpha-Agonists / therapeutic use* Adult Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use Cognition Disorders / drug therapy* Cognition Disorders / etiology* Double-Blind Method Female Guanfacine / therapeutic use* Humans Male Middle Aged Prefrontal Cortex / physiology Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Reaction Time / drug effects Risperidone / therapeutic use Schizophrenia / complications* Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Schizophrenic Psychology*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Effective treatments for cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS) remain an unmet need. Nicotinic α7 receptor agonists may be effective in CIAS. This 8-week (week 1, inpatient; weeks 2-8, outpatient), double-blind, randomized study used Measurement And Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) guidelines to investigate the nicotinic α7 partial agonist RG3487 (formerly MEM3454) in CIAS; 215 patients with chronic stable schizophrenia received placebo or RG3487 (5, 15, or 50 mg) added to ongoing treatment with risperidone, paliperidone, or aripiprazole. Primary end point was baseline to week 8 change in MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) composite t-score. Secondary outcomes were change in MCCB domain and negative symptom assessment (NSA) scores. The study did not allow for evaluation of nonsmokers. Each RG3487 dose was evaluated using a mixed-effects model repeated measures approach. Mean (SD) baseline MCCB composite t-score was 28.3 (12.0). No significant effect on MCCB composite t-scores was observed with RG3487 (adjusted mean difference (SE) vs placebo: 5 mg: 0.11 (1.39); 15 mg: -1.95 (1.39); 50 mg: -1.13 (1.37); p = 0.2-0.9). RG3487 did not improve MCCB domain scores. In a post hoc analysis of patients with moderate negative symptoms, 5 and 50 mg RG3487 vs placebo significantly improved NSA total (-4.45 (p = 0.04) and -4.75 (p = 0.02), respectively) and global (-0.39 (p = 0.04) and -0.55 (p = 0.003), respectively) scores. The MCCB did not lead to higher than expected patient withdrawal. RG3487 was generally well tolerated. In patients with stable schizophrenia, RG3487 did not improve cognitive deficits, as assessed by the MCCB; however, in patients with moderate negative symptoms, a post hoc analysis revealed significant improvement of negative symptoms.Adolescent Adult Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use Bridged Bicyclo Compounds / therapeutic use* Cognition Disorders / drug therapy* Cognition Disorders / etiology* Double-Blind Method Female Humans Indazoles / therapeutic use* Male Middle Aged Neuropsychological Tests Nicotinic Agonists / therapeutic use* Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Schizophrenia / complications* Schizophrenia / drug therapy Schizophrenic Psychology* Treatment Outcome Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Neuroscience-guided cognitive training induces significant improvement in cognition in schizophrenia subjects, but the biological mechanisms associated with these changes are unknown. In animals, intensive cognitive activity induces increased brain levels of the NMDA-receptor co-agonist d-serine, a molecular system that plays a role in learning-induced neuroplasticity and that may be hypoactive in schizophrenia. Here, we investigated whether training-induced gains in cognition were associated with increases in serum d-serine in outpatients with schizophrenia. Ninety patients with schizophrenia and 53 healthy controls were assessed on baseline serum d-serine, l-serine, and glycine. Schizophrenia subjects performed neurocognitive tests and were assigned to 50 h of either cognitive training of auditory processing systems (N = 47) or a computer games control condition (N = 43), followed by reassessment of cognition and serum amino acids. At study entry, the mean serum d-serine level was significantly lower in schizophrenia subjects vs. healthy subjects, while the glycine levels were significantly higher. There were no significant changes in these measures at a group level after the intervention. However, in the active training group, increased d-serine was significantly and positively correlated with improvements in global cognition and in Verbal Learning. No such associations were observed in the computer games control subjects, and no such associations were found for glycine. d-Serine may be involved in the neurophysiologic changes induced by cognitive training in schizophrenia. Pharmacologic strategies that target d-serine co-agonism of NMDA-receptor functioning may provide a mechanism for enhancing the behavioral effects of intensive cognitive training.Adult Cognitive Dysfunction / blood* Cognitive Dysfunction / etiology Cognitive Dysfunction / rehabilitation* Cognitive Remediation* Female Glycine / blood Humans Male Middle Aged Neuronal Plasticity* / physiology Outcome Assessment, Health Care Schizophrenia / blood* Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / rehabilitation* Serine / blood* Verbal Learning / physiology Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Studies have shown that insulin resistance is associated with cognitive impairment. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) agonists improve insulin sensitivity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of rosiglitazone, a PPAR-γ agonist, on cognition in clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia. In an eight-week double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial, clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia were randomized to receive rosiglitazone (4mg/day) or placebo. A neuropsychological battery including the Digit Span subtest from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III), the verbal fluency test, the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT), the Trail-Making Test (TMT) and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) was administered at baseline and week eight. Nineteen patients completed the study. There were no significant differences on any demographic or general clinical variables between the rosiglitazone group (n=9) and the placebo group (n=10). When baseline scores were controlled, there were no significant differences in change scores of cognitive performance over eight weeks between the two groups. In this pilot study, rosiglitazone had no cognitive benefit in clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia. Future studies with longer treatment duration and larger sample size are needed to further explore the potential role of rosiglitazone in improving cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia.Adult Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use* Clozapine / therapeutic use* Cognition / drug effects* Cognition Disorders / complications Cognition Disorders / drug therapy* Double-Blind Method Female Humans Hypoglycemic Agents / pharmacology Hypoglycemic Agents / therapeutic use* Male Middle Aged Neuropsychological Tests PPAR gamma / agonists Pilot Projects Rosiglitazone Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Thiazolidinediones / pharmacology Thiazolidinediones / therapeutic use* Treatment OutcomeQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR) agonists may be valuable treatments for negative symptoms and cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. Unfortunately, chronic exposure to an agonist may reduce the receptor's sensitivity. Therefore, we combined CDP-choline, a dietary source of the direct agonist choline, with galantamine, a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, to improve the efficiency of transducing the choline signal and, possibly, preserve the receptor in a sensitive state. We conducted a single-site, double-blind randomized clinical trial comparing galantamine/CDP-choline to placebos in schizophrenia patients with negative symptoms who were receiving second generation antipsychotics. Forty-three subjects received galantamine and CDP-choline or matching placebos for 16weeks. The primary outcome measure was the 5-item Marder negative-symptoms factor of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Cognition and functioning were also assessed. Trial completion was high; 79%. There was no significant treatment effect on negative symptoms, other PANSS symptom factors, or the MATRICS Cognitive Consensus Battery. There were significant treatment effects in overall functioning and a test of free verbal recall. Three subjects discontinued treatment in the active treatment group for gastro-intestinal adverse events (AE). The most common AE for galantamine/CDP-choline was abdominal pain; for placebo it was headache and sweating. Although there was no significant treatment effect on negative symptoms, the direction of effect mirrored the effects on a cognitive measure and overall functioning. Further study of α7 nAChR agonist/PAMs is warranted in larger studies that will have greater power.Adult Aged Cognition Disorders / drug therapy Cognition Disorders / etiology Cytidine Diphosphate Choline / therapeutic use Double-Blind Method Female Galantamine / therapeutic use Humans Male Middle Aged Neuropsychological Tests Nootropic Agents / therapeutic use Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Psychotic Disorders / complications Psychotic Disorders / drug therapy Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Synaptic Transmission / drug effects Treatment Outcome alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor / drug effects* alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor / metabolismQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "This exploratory trial was conducted to test the effects of an alpha7 nicotinic receptor partial agonist, TC-5619, on cognitive dysfunction and negative symptoms in subjects with schizophrenia. In the United States and India, 185 outpatients (18-60 years; male 69%; 46% tobacco users) with schizophrenia treated with quetiapine or risperidone monotherapy were randomized to 12 weeks of placebo (n=91) or TC-5619 (n=94; orally once daily 1 mg day 1 to week 4, 5 mg week 4 to 8, and 25 mg week 8 to 12). The primary efficacy outcome measure was the Groton Maze Learning Task (GMLT; executive function) of the CogState Schizophrenia Battery (CSB). Secondary outcome measures included: CSB composite score; Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS); Clinical Global Impression-Global Improvement (CGI-I); CGI-severity (CGI-S); and Subject Global Impression-Cognition. GMLT statistically favored TC-5619 (P=0.036) in this exploratory trial. SANS also statistically favored TC-5619 (P=0.030). No other secondary outcome measure demonstrated a drug effect in the total population; there was a statistically significant drug effect on working memory in tobacco users. The results were typically stronger in favor of TC-5619 in tobacco users and occasionally better in the United States than in India. TC-5619 was generally well tolerated with no clinically noteworthy safety findings. These results support the potential benefits of TC-5619 and alpha7 nicotinic receptor partial agonists for cognitive dysfunction and negative symptoms in schizophrenia.Adolescent Adult Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use Benzofurans / therapeutic use* Female Humans India / epidemiology Male Middle Aged Nicotinic Agonists / therapeutic use* Nootropic Agents / therapeutic use* Quinuclidines / therapeutic use* Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Schizophrenia / epidemiology Schizophrenic Psychology* United States / epidemiology Young Adult alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor / physiology*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Schizophrenia is associated with deficits in cortical plasticity that affect sensory brain regions and lead to impaired cognitive performance. Here we examined underlying neural mechanisms of auditory plasticity deficits using combined behavioural and neurophysiological assessment, along with neuropharmacological manipulation targeted at the N-methyl-D-aspartate type glutamate receptor (NMDAR). Cortical plasticity was assessed in a cohort of 40 schizophrenia/schizoaffective patients relative to 42 healthy control subjects using a fixed reference tone auditory plasticity task. In a second cohort (n = 21 schizophrenia/schizoaffective patients, n = 13 healthy controls), event-related potential and event-related time-frequency measures of auditory dysfunction were assessed during administration of the NMDAR agonist d-serine. Mismatch negativity was used as a functional read-out of auditory-level function. Clinical trials registration numbers were NCT01474395/NCT02156908 Schizophrenia/schizoaffective patients showed significantly reduced auditory plasticity versus healthy controls (P = 0.001) that correlated with measures of cognitive, occupational and social dysfunction. In event-related potential/time-frequency analyses, patients showed highly significant reductions in sensory N1 that reflected underlying impairments in θ responses (P < 0.001), along with reduced θ and β-power modulation during retention and motor-preparation intervals. Repeated administration of d-serine led to intercorrelated improvements in (i) auditory plasticity (P < 0.001); (ii) θ-frequency response (P < 0.05); and (iii) mismatch negativity generation to trained versus untrained tones (P = 0.02). Schizophrenia/schizoaffective patients show highly significant deficits in auditory plasticity that contribute to cognitive, occupational and social dysfunction. d-serine studies suggest first that NMDAR dysfunction may contribute to underlying cortical plasticity deficits and, second, that repeated NMDAR agonist administration may enhance cortical plasticity in schizophrenia.Adult Auditory Perceptual Disorders / diet therapy Auditory Perceptual Disorders / physiopathology* Brain Waves / drug effects Brain Waves / physiology* Cohort Studies Evoked Potentials, Auditory / drug effects Evoked Potentials, Auditory / physiology* Excitatory Amino Acid Agonists / administration & dosage Excitatory Amino Acid Agonists / pharmacology* Female Humans Male Middle Aged Neuronal Plasticity / drug effects Neuronal Plasticity / physiology* Psychotic Disorders / drug therapy Psychotic Disorders / physiopathology* Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate / agonists* Schizophrenia / drug therapy Schizophrenia / physiopathology* Serine / administration & dosage Serine / pharmacology*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Second-generation antipsychotics yield only a modest improvement in cognitive benefit compared to first-generation antipsychotics. Aripiprazole, which is a partial dopamine D2 receptor agonist, may have an impact on cognitive dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia. This study administered aripiprazole or placebo to 36 outpatients with schizophrenia also receiving risperidone or olanzapine for 12 weeks in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) just prior to drug administration as well as 12 weeks after. The PANSS and UKU side effect rating scales were used to evaluate the clinical response to additional treatment with aripiprazole. In a primary analyses, ANCOVA showed that there was an interaction between the treatment group and time for verbal fluency (p < 0.05), but not for any domain in BACS, PANSS or UKU side effect rating scales. Upon secondary analysis, however, the ameliorative change in motor speed as assessed by the BACS (p < 0.05) for those receiving aripiprazole was greater than that for the placebo group, whereas deterioration in verbal fluency (p < 0.01) and executive function (p < 0.01) in those receiving aripiprazole was significantly greater than in the placebo group. These results suggest that adjunctive treatment with aripiprazole improves motor speed but worsens some cognitive functions. It is likely that these effects are due to the dopamine D2 antagonistic effect of aripiprazole.Adult Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation / therapeutic use* Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use* Aripiprazole Benzodiazepines / therapeutic use Chemotherapy, Adjuvant Cognition / drug effects* Cognition Disorders / chemically induced Cognition Disorders / drug therapy* Double-Blind Method Female Humans Male Olanzapine Piperazines / adverse effects Piperazines / therapeutic use* Quinolones / adverse effects Quinolones / therapeutic use* Receptors, Dopamine D2 / agonists Receptors, Dopamine D2 / metabolism Risperidone / therapeutic use Schizophrenia / drug therapy*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Cognitive functioning can be assessed with performance-based assessments such as neuropsychological tests and with interview-based assessments. Both assessment methods have the potential to assess whether treatments for schizophrenia improve clinically relevant aspects of cognitive impairment. However, little is known about the reliability, validity and treatment responsiveness of interview-based measures, especially in the context of clinical trials. Data from two studies were utilized to assess these features of the Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale (SCoRS). One of the studies was a validation study involving 79 patients with schizophrenia assessed at 3 academic research centers in the US. The other study was a 32-site clinical trial conducted in the US and Europe comparing the effects of encenicline, an alpha-7 nicotine agonist, to placebo in 319 patients with schizophrenia. The SCoRS interviewer ratings demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability in several different circumstances, including those that did not involve treatment (ICC> 0.90), and during treatment (ICC>0.80). SCoRS interviewer ratings were related to cognitive performance as measured by the MCCB (r=-0.35), and demonstrated significant sensitivity to treatment with encenicline compared to placebo (P<.001). These data suggest that the SCoRS has potential as a clinically relevant measure in clinical trials aiming to improve cognition in schizophrenia, and may be useful for clinical practice. The weaknesses of the SCoRS include its reliance on informant information, which is not available for some patients, and reduced validity when patient's self-report is the sole information source.Adult Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use Cognition Disorders / diagnosis Cognition Disorders / physiopathology Cognition* / drug effects Europe Factor Analysis, Statistical Female Humans Interview, Psychological / methods* Male Psychiatric Status Rating Scales* Psychometrics Reproducibility of Results Schizophrenia / diagnosis* Schizophrenia / drug therapy Schizophrenia / physiopathology Schizophrenic Psychology* Sensitivity and Specificity United States alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor / agonistsQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Cognitive impairment is a cause of significant disability in patients with schizophrenia. To date, no drug has been approved for this indication by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This article presents findings suggesting that a medication targeting the alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR) might meet this need. This single-center, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind,placebo-controlled study examined 21 medically stable patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder treated with second generation antipsychotics. Patients were treated with a daily dose of either 0.3 mg (n=8) or 1.0 mg (n=9) of EVP-6124, an α7 nAChR partial agonist, or placebo (n=4). Treatment continued for 21 days while patients continued their usual antipsychotic medication: aripiprazole (10-30 mg/day), olanzapine (10-20 mg/day), paliperidone (3-12 mg/day), or risperidone (2-16 mg/day). Cognitive test performance, eventrelated electroencephalographic (EEG) potentials, clinical symptoms, laboratory values, and clinical side effects were measured. EVP-6124 was well tolerated and showed positive, and in some cases, dose-dependent effects on several EEG responses, especially the Mismatch Negativity and P300 potentials. Positive effects were also found in performance on cognitive tests that measured non-verbal learning, memory, and executive function. This study is an example of the type of early proof of concept trial that is done to enable drug developers to evaluate whether to continue research on an agent. Based on the promising findings in this study, larger phase II studies were initiated to further test the pro-cognitive effects of EVP-6124 in patients with chronic schizophrenia.\n",

      "Cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia is a key predictor of functional outcomes. The FDA-accepted MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) is held to be the gold standard measure but there are concerns about its ease of administration, reliance on language causing problems with translation and possible practice effects. The CogState Schizophrenia Battery (SB) is suggested as a non-language-based alternative but there is no substantial, independent comparison.\n",
      "The objective of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of these two assessment batteries.\n",
      "One hundred forty-three participants with DSM-IV schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder were recruited into three similar studies. Each study administered MCCB and SB tests on consecutive days (baseline 1 and 2) and follow-up 3-4 weeks later.\n",
      "Batteries' test-retest reliability was similar: SB composites correlated r = 0.66-0.78 between baselines, MCCB domains r = 0.69-0.90. Baseline 2 and follow-up SB composites correlated r = 0.65-0.80 and MCCB domains r = 0.62-0.87. MCCB tasks' practice effects (Glass' ∆ = 0.02-0.46) exceeded SB's (Glass' ∆ = 0.02-0.34). While the batteries' total scores correlated strongly (r = 0.79-0.82), apparently equivalent cognitive domains on each battery (e.g. psychomotor-attention) correlated r = 0.22-0.60, indicating substantial differences between some supposed counterparts.\n",
      "Clinical trials using either battery would benefit from initial practice sessions to ameliorate practice effects but the SB may be more suitable to measure change in the absence of repeated baselines. The MCCB domains' better correlations with social skills performance suggest that it may have an advantage for measuring cognition in relation to functional outcome.Adult Attention Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use Calibration Central Nervous System Stimulants / therapeutic use Cognition Disorders / diagnosis* Cognition Disorders / etiology Cognition Disorders / psychology* Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Double-Blind Method Female Humans Language Male Modafinil Neuropsychological Tests* Nicotinic Agonists / pharmacology Nicotinic Agonists / therapeutic use Psychomotor Performance Psychotic Disorders / diagnosis Psychotic Disorders / psychology Reproducibility of Results Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Schizophrenic Psychology* Social Behavior alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor / drug effectsQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "The negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia are poorly responsive to neuroleptic treatment. Glutamatergic dysfunction may mediate some of these symptoms. Low dose D-cycloserine (DCS) is a partial agonist at the glycine site of the NMDA-associated receptor complex, noncompetitively enhancing NMDA neurotransmission. Prior studies suggest a beneficial effect of DCS on negative symptoms and cognition. This treatment trial was initiated to confirm and extend these findings.\n",
      "Twenty-two male schizophrenic subjects displaying prominent negative symptoms who were stabilized on typical neuroleptics completed the study. A randomized double-blind parallel group design was used to compare the effects of 50 mg p.o. QD of DCS to placebo over 4 weeks. The two subject groups did not differ significantly in age, age of onset of illness or time on current neuroleptic treatment. Symptoms were rated by means of the SANS, BPRS and Abrams and Taylor rating scale. Cognition was assessed with the Sternberg Memory Test and the Continuous Performance Test.\n",
      "Both medication groups improved over the 4 weeks of treatment. However, there were no significant differences between the DCS and placebo group on any symptom rating. DCS effects on cognition did not differ from placebo.\n",
      "This study did not detect improvement in negative symptoms or cognitive performance with DCS treatment that has been found in some prior studies. This negative finding may be attributed to small sample size, relatively short duration of treatment and the overall modest effect of DCS. Future studies of DCS should be adequately powered to detect a small to medium effect size and should provide for a longer treatment phase than was used in this study in order to avoid a type II error.Affect / drug effects* Antimetabolites / administration & dosage Antimetabolites / pharmacology* Antipsychotic Agents / blood Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use* Cognition Disorders / diagnosis* Cycloserine / administration & dosage Cycloserine / pharmacology* Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Double-Blind Method Drug Administration Schedule Glycine / metabolism Humans Male Middle Aged Neuropsychological Tests Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate / drug effects Schizophrenia / diagnosis Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Severity of Illness IndexQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Novel pharmacological treatments targeting alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR) hypofunction in schizophrenia have shown mixed success in ameliorating cognitive impairments associated with this disorder. Choline, a selective agonist at α7 receptors is increased with oral administration of cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine (CDP-choline), the cognitive effects of which were assessed in healthy volunteers. Using the CogState test battery, behavioral performance in schizophrenia-relevant cognitive domains was assessed in 24 male participants following a single low (500mg) and moderate (1000mg) dose of CDP-choline. Relative to placebo, CDP-choline improved processing speed, working memory, verbal learning, verbal memory, and executive function in low baseline performers, while exerting no effects in medium baseline performers, and diminishing cognition in high baseline performers. Dose effects varied with cognitive domain but were evident with both the 500mg and 1000mg doses. These preliminary findings of cognitive enhancement in relatively impaired performers are consistent with the α7 receptor mechanism and support further trials with CDP-choline as a potential pro-cognitive strategy for cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.Adolescent Adult Choline / administration & dosage Choline / pharmacology* Cognition / drug effects* Cross-Over Studies Double-Blind Method Humans Male Neuropsychological Tests Nootropic Agents / administration & dosage Nootropic Agents / pharmacology* Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "We investigated the effects of a single dose of nicotine on episodic memory performance in 10 adults with schizophrenia and 12 healthy controls. Participants were nonsmokers in order to avoid confounding effects of nicotine withdrawal and reinstatement on memory.

      "Nearly 90% of schizophrenics smoke cigarettes, considerably higher than the general population's rate of 25%. There is some indication that schizophrenics may smoke as a form of self-medication. Nicotine has a variety of pharmacologic effects that may both counteract some of the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia and counteract some of the adverse side effects of antipsychotic drugs. In the current study, we assessed the interactions of haloperidol and nicotine on cognitive performance of a group of schizophrenics. These patients were in a double-blind study, randomly assigning them to low, moderate, and high dose levels of haloperidol. The subjects, all smokers, came to the laboratory on four different mornings after overnight deprivation from cigarettes. In a double-blind fashion, they were administered placebo, low (7 mg/day), medium (14 mg/day), or high (21 mg/day) dose nicotine skin patches. Three hours after administration of the skin patch, the subjects were given a computerized cognitive test battery including: simple reaction time, complex reaction time (spatial rotation), delayed matching to sample, the Sternberg memory test, and the Conners continuous performance test (CPT). With the placebo nicotine patch, there was a haloperidol dose-related impairment in delayed matching to sample choice accuracy and an increase in response time on the complex reaction time task. Nicotine caused a dose-related reversal of the haloperidol-induced impairments in memory performance and complex reaction time. In the CPT, nicotine reduced the variability in response that is associated with attentional deficit. These results demonstrate the effects of nicotine in reversing some of the adverse side effects of haloperidol and improving cognitive performance in schizophrenia.Adult Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use* Cognition / drug effects* Drug Synergism Female Haloperidol / therapeutic use* Humans Male Memory / drug effects Middle Aged Nicotine / therapeutic use* Nicotinic Agonists / therapeutic use* Reaction Time Schizophrenia / drug therapy*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Abundant evidence indicates that the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) system is integral to regulation of attentional processes and is dysregulated in schizophrenia. Nicotinic agonists may have potential for the treatment of cognitive impairment in this disease. This study investigated the effects of transdermal nicotine on attention in individuals with schizophrenia (n=28) and healthy controls (n=32). All participants were nonsmokers in order to eliminate confounding effects of nicotine withdrawal and reinstatement that may occur in the study of smokers. Subjects received 14 mg transdermal nicotine and identical placebo in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design. A cognitive battery was conducted before and 3 h after each patch application. The primary outcome measure was performance on the Continuous Performance Test Identical Pairs (CPT-IP) Version. Nicotine significantly improved the performance on the CPT-IP as measured by hit reaction time, hit reaction time standard deviation and random errors in both groups. In addition, nicotine reduced commission errors on the CPT-IP and improved the performance on a Card Stroop task to a greater extent in those with schizophrenia vs controls. In summary, nicotine improved attentional performance in both groups and was associated with greater improvements in inhibition of impulsive responses in subjects with schizophrenia. These results confirm previous findings that a single dose of nicotine improves attention and suggest that nicotine may specifically improve response inhibition in nonsmokers with schizophrenia.Administration, Cutaneous Adult Analysis of Variance Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use Attention / drug effects Cognition / drug effects* Cross-Over Studies Double-Blind Method Female Humans Male Middle Aged Neuropsychological Tests Nicotine / administration & dosage Nicotine / adverse effects Nicotine / pharmacology* Nicotinic Agonists / administration & dosage Nicotinic Agonists / adverse effects Nicotinic Agonists / pharmacology* Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Psychomotor Performance / drug effects Schizophrenic Psychology*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Pharmacological enhancement of prefrontal D1 dopamine receptor function remains a promising therapeutic approach to ameliorate schizophrenia-spectrum working memory deficits, but has yet to be rigorously evaluated clinically. This proof-of-principle study sought to determine whether the active enantiomer of the selective and full D1 receptor agonist dihydrexidine (DAR-0100A) could attenuate working memory impairments in unmedicated patients with schizotypal personality disorder (SPD). We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of DAR-0100A (15 mg/150 ml of normal saline administered intravenously over 30 min) in medication-free patients with SPD (n=16) who met the criteria for cognitive impairment (ie, scoring below the 25th percentile on tests of working memory). We employed two measures of verbal working memory that are salient to schizophrenia-spectrum cognitive deficits, and that clinical data implicate as being associated with prefrontal D1 availability: (1) the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT); and (2) the N-back test (ratio of 2-back:0-back scores). Study procedures occurred over four consecutive days, with working memory testing on Days 1 and 4, and DAR-0100A/placebo administration on Days 2-4. Treatment with DAR-0100A was associated with significantly improved PASAT performance relative to placebo, with a very large effect size (Cohen's d=1.14). Performance on the N-back ratio was also significantly improved; however, this effect rested on both a non-significant enhancement and diminution of 2-back and 0-back performance, respectively; therefore interpretation of this finding is more complicated. DAR-0100A was generally well tolerated, with no serious medical or psychiatric adverse events; common side effects were mild to moderate and transient, consisting mainly of sedation, lightheadedness, tachycardia, and hypotension; however, we were able to minimize these effects, without altering the dose, with supportive measures, eg, co-administered normal saline. Although preliminary, these findings lend further clinical support to the potential of D1 receptor agonists to treat schizophrenia-spectrum working memory impairments. These data suggest a need for further studies with larger group sizes, serum DAR-0100A levels, and a more comprehensive neuropsychological battery.Adult Dopamine Agonists / adverse effects Dopamine Agonists / therapeutic use* Double-Blind Method Female Humans Male Memory Disorders / drug therapy* Memory Disorders / physiopathology Memory, Short-Term / drug effects* Memory, Short-Term / physiology Middle Aged Neuropsychological Tests Phenanthridines / adverse effects Phenanthridines / therapeutic use* Receptors, Dopamine D1 / agonists* Receptors, Dopamine D1 / metabolism Schizotypal Personality Disorder / drug therapy* Schizotypal Personality Disorder / physiopathology Schizotypal Personality Disorder / psychology Verbal Learning / drug effects Verbal Learning / physiology Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Deficits in N-methyl-d-aspartate-type (NMDAR) function contribute to symptoms and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. The efficacy of NMDAR agonists in the treatment of persistent symptoms of schizophrenia has been variable, potentially reflecting limitations in functional target engagement. We recently demonstrated significant improvement in auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) with once-weekly treatment with d-serine, a naturally occurring NMDAR glycine-site agonist. This study investigates effects of continuous (daily) NMDAR agonists in schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder.\n",
      "Primary analysis was on MMN after double-blind crossover (60mg/kg/d, n=16, 6weeks) treatment with d-serine/placebo. Secondary measures included clinical symptoms, neurocognition, and the effects of open-label (30-120mg/kg/d, n=21) d-serine and bitopertin/placebo (10mg, n=29), a glycine transport inhibitor.\n",
      "Double-blind d-serine treatment led to significant improvement in MMN frequency (p=0.001, d=2.3) generation and clinical symptoms (p=0.023, d=0.80). MMN frequency correlated significantly with change in symptoms (r=-0.63, p=0.002) following co-variation for treatment type. d-Serine treatment led to a significant, large effect size increase vs. placebo in evoked α-power in response to standards (p=0.036, d=0.81), appearing to normalize evoked α power relative to previous findings with controls. While similar results were seen with open-label d-serine, no significant effects of bitopertin were observed for symptoms or MMN.\n",
      "These findings represent the first randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study with 60mg/kg d-serine in schizophrenia, and are consistent with meta-analyses showing significant effects of d-serine in schizophrenia. Results overall support suggest that MMN may have negative, as well as positive, predictive value in predicting efficacy of novel compounds.\n",

      "Inositol is a simple polyol precursor in a second messenger system important in the brain. Cerebrospinal fluid inositol has been reported as decreased in depression. A double-blind controlled trial of 12 g daily of inositol in 28 depressed patients for four weeks was performed. Significant overall benefit for inositol compared to placebo was found at week 4 on the Hamilton Depression Scale. No changes were noted in hematology, kidney or liver function. Since many antidepressants are effective in panic disorder, twenty-one patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, four week, random-assignment crossover treatment trial of inositol 12 g per day. Frequency and severity of panic attacks and severity of agoraphobia declined significantly with inositol compared to placebo. Side-effects were minimal. Since serotonin re-uptake inhibitors benefit obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and inositol is reported to reverse desensitization of serotonin receptors, thirteen patients with OCD completed a double-blind controlled crossover trial of 18 g inositol or placebo for six weeks each. Inositol significantly reduced scores of OCD symptoms compared with placebo. A controlled double-blind crossover trial of 12 g daily of inositol for a month in twelve anergic schizophrenic patients, did not show any beneficial effects. A double-blind controlled crossover trial of 6 g of inositol daily vs. glucose for one month each was carried out in eleven Alzheimer patients, with on clearly significant therapeutic effects. Antidepressant drugs have been reported to improve attention deficit disorder (ADDH) with hyperactivity symptomatology. We studied oral inositol in children with ADDH in a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled manner. Eleven children, mean age 8.9 +/- 3.6 years were enrolled in an eight week trial of inositol or placebo at a dose of 200 mg/kg body weight. Results show a trend for aggravation of the syndrome with myo-inositol as compared to placebo. Recent studies suggest that serotonin re-uptake inhibitors are helpful in at least some symptoms of autism. However a controlled double-blind crossover trial of inositol 200 mg/kg per day showed no benefit in nine children with autism. Cholinergic agonists have been reported to ameliorate electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)-induced memory impairment. Inositol metabolism is involved in the second messenger system for several muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Inositol 6 g daily was given in a crossover-double-blind manner for five days before the fifth or sixth ECT to a series of twelve patients, without effect. These results suggest that inositol has therapeutic effects in the spectrum of illness responsive to serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors, including depression, panic and OCD, and is not beneficial in schizophrenia, Alzheimer's ADDH, autism or ECT-induced cognitive impairment.Adult Alzheimer Disease / drug therapy Depressive Disorder / drug therapy Double-Blind Method Female Humans Inositol / therapeutic use* Male Mental Disorders / drug therapy* Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder / drug therapy Panic Disorder / drug therapy Schizophrenia / drug therapyQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "We conducted a 24-week, randomized, double-blind parallel-controlled trial to test whether buspirone is beneficial to improve cognitive deficits of schizophrenia because it remains unclear. Two hundred patients received in random order either co-treatment buspirone with AAPDs or monotherapy with AAPDs. All patients had been treated with a stable dosage of AAPDs for at least three months. The positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS), Hamilton Depression Scale-24 (HAMD-24), and 14-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAMA-14) were used to evaluate clinical symptoms. The short version of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised in China (WAIS-RC) was used to assess neurocognitive function. Social function and family burden were evaluated by Social Disability Screening Schedule (SDSS) and Family Burden Interview Schedule (FBIS). All patients were enrolled at baseline and followed up after 12 and 24 weeks. A total of 196 patients completed the trial, with 99 in the combined treatment group and 97 in the control group. During the intervention, the score of PANSS, HAMD-24, and HAMA-14 decreased slightly without group differences. Repeated measures ANOVA showed significant differences between the two groups in the score of arithmetic, similarities, picture completion, block design, SDSS, and FBIS (P < 0.05), but no difference was found with regard to the score of information, digital span test, or digital symbols (P > 0.05). In conclusion, co-treatment with buspirone and APPDs outperformed APPDs alone in improving cognitive deficit and reducing family burden of schizophrenia. Buspirone may be a promising candidate for co-treatment of schizophrenia-associated cognitive deficits.Adolescent Adult Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use* Anxiety / psychology Buspirone / therapeutic use* Cognition Cognitive Dysfunction / drug therapy* Cognitive Dysfunction / etiology Cognitive Dysfunction / physiopathology Cognitive Dysfunction / psychology Depression / psychology Double-Blind Method Drug Therapy, Combination Female Humans Male Middle Aged Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Schizophrenia / physiopathology Schizophrenic Psychology* Serotonin Receptor Agonists / therapeutic use* Treatment Outcome Wechsler Scales Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Patients meeting criteria for the risk syndrome for psychosis have treatment needs including positive and negative symptoms and cognitive impairment. These features could potentially respond to NMDA glycine-site agonists. The present objective was to determine which symptoms or domains of cognition promise to show the greatest response to glycine in risk syndrome patients. We conducted two short-term pilot studies of glycine used without adjunctive antipsychotic medication. In the first trial, 10 risk syndrome subjects received open-label glycine at doses titrated to 0.8 g/kg/d for 8 weeks, followed by discontinuation and 16 weeks of evaluation for durability of effects. In the second, 8 subjects were randomized to double-blind glycine vs. placebo for 12 weeks, followed by open-label glycine for another 12 weeks. Patients were evaluated every 1-2 weeks with the Scale Of Psychosis-risk Symptoms (SOPS) and before and after treatment with a neurocognitive battery. Within-group and between-group effect sizes were calculated. Effect sizes were large for positive (open-label within-group -1.10, double-blind between-group -1.11) and total (-1.39 and -1.15) symptoms and medium-to-large (-0.74 and -0.79) for negative symptoms. Medium or large effect sizes were also observed for several neurocognitive measures in the open-label study, although data were sparse. No safety concerns were identified. We conclude that glycine was associated with reduced symptoms with promising effect sizes in two pilot studies and a possibility of improvement in cognitive function. Further studies of agents that facilitate NMDA receptor function in risk syndrome patients are supported by these preliminary findings.Adolescent Adolescent Behavior Adult Cognition Disorders / etiology Cognition Disorders / prevention & control Dietary Supplements* / adverse effects Double-Blind Method Female Follow-Up Studies Glycine / adverse effects Glycine / therapeutic use* Glycine Agents / adverse effects Glycine Agents / therapeutic use* Humans Male Nutritive Sweeteners / adverse effects Nutritive Sweeteners / therapeutic use Pilot Projects Prodromal Symptoms Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Psychotic Disorders / epidemiology Psychotic Disorders / physiopathology Psychotic Disorders / prevention & control* Risk United States / epidemiology Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Semantic priming is a function related to prefrontal cortical (PFC) networks and is lateralized. There is evidence that semantic priming underlies dopaminergic modulation. It is known that the D1-receptor is more abundant in prefrontal networks; however, until now there have been no studies investigating the selective modulation of semantic priming with dopamine agonists. Furthermore, D1 receptor dysfunction has been described in schizophrenia, and patients with formal thought disorder seem to have disturbed focusing of associations and increased indirect priming.\n",
      "With a subtraction design, we compared the influence of pergolide (D1/D2 agonist) with bromocriptine (D2 agonist) and placebo, in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design in 40 healthy male volunteers. Subjects performed a lateralized lexical decision task including direct and indirect related prime-target pairs (stimulus onset asynchrony = 750 msec).\n",
      "Only on pergolide a decrease of the indirect priming in the left hemisphere presentations was found.\n",
      "These findings point to a potential selective modulation of agonists with a D1 component on the focusing of semantic associations. The clinical relevance of this study is that it might help the development of therapeutic strategies for treating cognitive deficits in schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease, which are highly relevant to the functional outcome.Adult Cross-Sectional Studies Decision Making / drug effects Decision Making / physiology Dopamine / metabolism* Dopamine Agonists / pharmacology* Double-Blind Method Functional Laterality Humans Male Neuropsychological Tests Paired-Associate Learning / drug effects* Paired-Associate Learning / physiology Pergolide / pharmacology* Photic Stimulation / methods Reaction Time / drug effects Reaction Time / physiology Semantics* Time Factors Visual Fields / drug effects Visual Fields / physiologyQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Elevated smoking rates seen in schizophrenia populations may be an attempt to correct neuropathologies associated with deficient nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and/or dopaminergic systems using exogenous nicotine. However, nicotine's effects on cognitive processing and sensory gating have been shown to be baseline-dependent. Evidence of a restorative effect on sensory gating deficits by nicotine-like agonists has been demonstrated, however, its underlying mechanisms in the context of dopamine dysregulation are unclear. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), a key dopamine regulator in the brain, contains a co-dominant allele in which a valine-to-methionine substitution causes variations in enzymatic activity leading to reduced synaptic dopamine levels in the Val/Val genotype. Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design with 57 non-smokers, this study examined the effects of COMT genotype on sensory gating and its modulation by nicotine in low vs. high suppressors. The results were consistent with the hypothesis that increased dopamine resulting from nicotine stimulation or Met allelic activity would benefit gating in low suppressors and impair gating in high suppressors, and that this gating improvement with nicotine would be more evident in Val carriers who were low suppressors, while the gating impairment would be more evident in Met carriers who were high suppressors. These findings reaffirm the importance of baseline-dependency and suggest a subtle relationship between COMT genotype and baseline-stratified levels of sensory gating, which may help to explain the variability of cognitive abilities in schizophrenia populations.Adolescent Adult Catechol O-Methyltransferase / genetics* Double-Blind Method Evoked Potentials / drug effects Evoked Potentials / genetics Genotype Humans Male Nicotine / pharmacology* Nicotinic Agonists / pharmacology* Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Sensory Gating / drug effects* Sensory Gating / genetics* Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Deficient sensory gating (SG) in schizophrenia is associated with functional outcome and offers a therapeutic target as it is linked to the altered function/expression of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). This study analyzed the effects of citicoline (CDP-choline), a supplement with α7 nAChRs agonist properties, on SG in a sample of schizophrenia (SZ) patients. Using a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind design the dose-dependent (500 mg, 1000 mg, 2000 mg) and baseline-dependent (deficient versus normal suppressors) effects of CDP-choline on SG were examined using the P50 event-related potential (ERP) index of SG. Overall analysis failed to demonstrate treatment effects but CDP-choline improved SG (500 mg) in the deficient SZ subgroup by increasing suppression of the S2 P50 amplitude. These findings tentatively support α7 nAChR dysfunction in the expression of SG deficits and suggest further trials to assess the effects of sustained α7 nAChR activation on SG with low doses of CDP-choline.Adolescent Adult Aged Cytidine Diphosphate Choline / pharmacology* Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Double-Blind Method Evoked Potentials / drug effects Evoked Potentials / physiology Female Humans Male Middle Aged Nootropic Agents / pharmacology Pilot Projects Schizophrenia / physiopathology* Sensory Gating / drug effects* Sensory Gating / physiology* Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Nicotine in tobacco smoke can improve functioning in multiple cognitive domains. High rates of smoking among schizophrenic patients may reflect an effort to remediate cognitive dysfunction. Our primary aim was to determine whether nicotine improves cognitive function by facilitating activation of brain regions mediating task performance or by facilitating functional connectivity.\n",
      "Thirteen smokers with schizophrenia and 13 smokers with no mental illness were withdrawn from tobacco and underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning twice, once after placement of a placebo patch and once after placement of a nicotine patch. During scanning, subjects performed an n-back task with two levels of working memory load and of selective attention load.\n",
      "During the most difficult (dichotic 2-back) task condition, nicotine improved performance of schizophrenic subjects and worsened performance of control subjects. Nicotine also enhanced activation of a network of regions, including anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral thalamus, and modulated thalamocortical functional connectivity to a greater degree in schizophrenic than in control subjects during dichotic 2-back task performance.\n",
      "In tasks that tax working memory and selective attention, nicotine may improve performance in schizophrenia patients by enhancing activation of and functional connectivity between brain regions that mediate task performance.Adult Analysis of Variance Attention / drug effects* Brain / drug effects* Brain / pathology Brain Mapping Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale Case-Control Studies Female Humans Image Processing, Computer-Assisted Magnetic Resonance Imaging / methods Male Memory, Short-Term / drug effects* Middle Aged Neuropsychological Tests Nicotine / blood Nicotine / pharmacology* Nicotinic Agonists / blood Nicotinic Agonists / pharmacology* Reaction Time / drug effects Regression Analysis Schizophrenia / pathology Schizophrenia / physiopathology* Smoke Task Performance and Analysis Verbal Learning / drug effects*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Encenicline (EVP-6124) is a selective α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist being developed for cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. We report on 2 single-dose studies to assess the relative bioavailability, pharmacokinetic profile, tolerability, and cognitive effects of encenicline in healthy volunteers.\n",
      "A single ascending-dose study assessed the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles of encenicline in healthy male volunteers. Subjects received a single 1-, 3.5-, 7-, 20-, 60-, or 180-mg oral solution dose of encenicline or placebo. A second single-dose, randomized, open-label, 3-period, crossover study in healthy male and female subjects compared the relative bioavailability of a 1-mg oral capsule versus a 1-mg oral solution dose of encenicline and evaluated the effects of food and sex on encenicline pharmacokinetic profile.\n",
      "In the first study, encenicline was well tolerated and dose-proportional increases in C(max) (mean range 0.59-100 ng/mL) and AUC0-∞ (mean range 45.6-8890 ng·h/mL) were observed over a 1- to 180-mg dose range. Procognitive effects on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test were maximal at the 20-mg dose. In the second study, encenicline 1-mg oral capsules and oral solution were bioequivalent and there was no observed food effect on encenicline pharmacokinetic profile with the 90% confidence intervals of the treatment ratios for both comparisons (ie, capsule to solution and fed to fasted) for Cmax and AUC being within 80% to 125%. A 30% to 40% higher encenicline exposure in female subjects than respective values in male subjects was consistent with a 33% higher weight of the male subjects. No clinically relevant safety profile or tolerability effects of encenicline were observed.\n",
      "Encenicline was well tolerated at single doses up to 180 mg, and doses as low as 1 mg had dose- and time-dependent pharmacodynamic effects on the central nervous system. Oral capsule and solution were bioequivalent and were not affected by food. Although a sex effect on pharmacokinetic profile was observed, it was attributable to weight differences.

      "This study evaluated whether pretreatment with a drug that reduces glutamatergic activation, the group II metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist, LY354740, reduced the cognitive effects of the NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist, ketamine, in healthy human subjects.\n",
      "Nineteen healthy human subjects completed 3 test days during which LY354740 (matched placebo, 100 mg, 400 mg) was administered under double-blind conditions 4 h prior to the single-blind intravenous administration of saline and 5.7 h prior to ketamine administration (bolus of 0.26 mg/kg over 1 min, infusion of 0.65 mg/kg per hour for 100 min). Thus on each test day each subject received a single dose of LY354740 (or its matched placebo) and both saline and ketamine infusions.\n",
      "Ketamine impaired attention, working memory, and delayed recall. It also produced positive and negative symptoms, perceptual changes, and dysphoric mood.

      "Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) is crucial for evaluating myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS) and assessing LV functions. In this study, a novel method combining deep learning with shape priors was developed and validated to extract the LV myocardium and automatically measure LV functional parameters. The method integrates a three-dimensional (3D) V-Net with a shape deformation module that incorporates shape priors generated by a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm to guide its output during training. A retrospective analysis was performed on an MPS dataset comprising 31 subjects without or with mild ischemia, 32 subjects with moderate ischemia, and 12 subjects with severe ischemia. Myocardial contours were manually annotated as the ground truth. A 5-fold stratified cross-validation was used to train and validate the models. The clinical performance was evaluated by measuring LV end-systolic volume (ESV), end-diastolic volume (EDV), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and scar burden from the extracted myocardial contours. There were excellent agreements between segmentation results by our proposed model and those from the ground truth, with a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.9573 ± 0.0244, 0.9821 ± 0.0137, and 0.9903 ± 0.0041, as well as Hausdorff distances (HD) of 6.7529 ± 2.7334 mm, 7.2507 ± 3.1952 mm, and 7.6121 ± 3.0134 mm in extracting the LV endocardium, myocardium, and epicardium, respectively. Furthermore, the correlation coefficients between LVEF, ESV, EDV, stress scar burden, and rest scar burden measured from our model results and the ground truth were 0.92, 0.958, 0.952, 0.972, and 0.958, respectively. The proposed method achieved a high accuracy in extracting LV myocardial contours and assessing LV functions.Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia predicts poor functional outcomes, but currently no approved pharmacotherapy is available. This study investigated whether the glycine transporter-1 inhibitor BI 425809 improves cognition in patients with schizophrenia.\n",
      "This phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (81 centres, 11 countries), randomly assigned outpatients (aged 18-50 years) with schizophrenia on stable treatment to add-on once-daily oral BI 425809 2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, or 25 mg or placebo (1:1:1:1:2) for 12 weeks. Treatment was assigned in blocks using interactive response technology; patients, investigators, and all trial personnel were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) overall composite T-score at week 12. Six predefined dose-response models were evaluated using a multiple comparison procedure and modelling approach with mixed model repeated measures to assess evidence for a non-flat dose-response relationship for cognitive improvements with BI 425809. Adverse events were monitored. Safety analyses included all randomly allocated patients who received one or more doses of trial medication; efficacy analyses included patients from this set who also had available baseline data and at least one post-baseline on-treatment measurement for the primary or secondary endpoint.

Five of six dose-response models showed a statistically significant benefit of BI 425809 over placebo (linear [t=2·55, p=0·015], linear in log [t=2·56, p=0·015]; Emax [t=2·75, p=0·0089], sigmoid Emax [t=2·98, p=0·0038], logistic [t=2·77, p=0·0085]). Pairwise comparisons showed greater mean improvement from baseline in MCCB overall composite T-score at week 12 with BI 425809 10 mg and 25 mg versus placebo (adjusted mean difference 1·98 [95% CI 0·43-3·53] for 10 mg and 1·73 [0·18-3·28] for 25 mg; standardised effect size 0·34 for 10 mg and 0·30 for 25 mg). Adverse events were balanced across groups, reported in 50 (59%) of 85 patients on BI 425809 2 mg, 44 (52%) of 84 on 5 mg, 35 (41%) of 85 on 10 mg, 36 (42%) of 85 on 25 mg, and 74 (44%) of 170 on placebo.\n",

      "Objectives Hypofunction of NMDA receptor is implicated in the pathophysiology, particularly cognitive impairment, of schizophrenia. Sarcosine, a glycine transporter I (GlyT-1) inhibitor, and sodium benzoate, a d-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) inhibitor, can both enhance NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission. We proposed simultaneously inhibiting DAAO and GlyT-1 may be more effective than inhibition of either in improving the cognitive and global functioning of schizophrenia patients. Methods This study compared add-on sarcosine (2 g/day) plus benzoate (1 g/day) vs. sarcosine (2 g/day) for the clinical symptoms, as well as the cognitive and global functioning, of chronic schizophrenia patients in a 12-week, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. Participants were measured with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale every 3 weeks. Seven cognitive domains, recommended by the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia Committee, were measured at weeks 0 and 12. Results Adjunctive sarcosine plus benzoate, but not sarcosine alone, improved the cognitive and global functioning of patients with schizophrenia, even when their clinical symptoms had not improved. Conclusions This finding suggests N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-enhancement therapy can improve the cognitive function of patients with schizophrenia, further indicating this pro-cognitive effect can be primary without improvement in clinical symptoms.Adult Antipsychotic Agents / administration & dosage* Basal Ganglia Diseases / etiology Benzoates / administration & dosage* Chronic Disease Cognition / drug effects* D-Amino-Acid Oxidase / antagonists & inhibitors Double-Blind Method Drug Therapy, Combination Female Glycine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins / antagonists & inhibitors Humans Male Middle Aged Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate / drug effects Sarcosine / administration & dosage* Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Synaptic Transmission / drug effects TaiwanQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Preponderance of serotonin 5-HT2A antagonism over dopamine D2 blockade exerted by atypical antipsychotics may contribute to their cognitive-enhancing effect. In a double-blind placebo-controlled study we examined the effect of add-on mianserin (15 mg/day), an agent with marked 5-HT2A antagonism, on cognitive functioning in 30 chronic hospitalized DSM-IV schizophrenia patients stabilized on typical antipsychotics. The Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) battery was used to assess learning, memory and sustained attention; Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) to assess executive function at baseline and endpoint (4 weeks). Clinical assessment included appropriate rating scales. The mianserin group overperformed the placebo group on selective ANAM memory/learning tests, reflected in moderate-to-high effect size values. No between-group differences were revealed in WCST and clinical ratings.\n",

      "Antipsychotic and other medications used in the treatment of schizophrenia place a burden on the cholinergic subsystems of the brain, which have been associated with increased cognitive impairment in the disorder. This study sought to examine the neurobiologic correlates of the association between serum anticholinergic activity (SAA) and cognitive impairments in early schizophrenia. Neurocognitive performance on measures of memory and executive function, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and SAA assays were collected from 47 early course, stabilized outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Voxel-based morphometry analyses employing general linear models, adjusting for demographic and illness-related confounds, were used to investigate the associations between SAA, gray matter morphology, and neurocognitive impairment. SAA was related to working memory and executive function impairments. Higher SAA was significantly associated with lower gray matter density in broad regions of the frontal and medial-temporal lobes, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), hippocampus, and striatum. Lower gray matter volume in the left DLPFC was found to significantly mediate the association between SAA and working memory impairment. Disease- and/or medication-related cholinergic dysfunction may be associated with brain volume abnormalities in early course schizophrenia, which may account for the association between SAA and cognitive dysfunction in the disorder.Adult Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use Cholinergic Antagonists / blood* Cognition Disorders / blood* Cognition Disorders / etiology* Cognition Disorders / rehabilitation Cognitive Behavioral Therapy / methods Executive Function / drug effects Executive Function / physiology Female Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Memory / drug effects Memory / physiology Neuropsychological Tests Prefrontal Cortex / pathology* Protein Binding / drug effects Receptors, Muscarinic / metabolism Schizophrenia / blood* Schizophrenia / complications* Schizophrenia / drug therapy Schizophrenia / pathology Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "The N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. We administered subanesthetic doses of the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine in a double-blind, placebo-controlled design to 13 neuroleptic-free schizophrenic patients to investigate if schizophrenics will experience an exacerbation of psychotic symptoms and cognitive impairments with ketamine. We also examined whether schizophrenics experienced quantitative or qualitative differences in ketamine response in comparison to normal controls. Schizophrenics experienced a brief-ketamine-induced exacerbation of positive and negative symptoms with further decrements in recall and recognition memory. They also displayed greater ketamine-induced impairments in free recall than normals. Qualitative differences included auditory hallucinations and paranoia in patients but not in normals. These data indicate that ketamine is associated with exacerbation of core psychotic and cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia. Moreover, ketamine may differentially affect cognition in schizophrenics in comparison to normal controls.Adult Cognition / drug effects* Cognition / physiology Double-Blind Method Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists / pharmacology* Female Humans Ketamine / pharmacology* Male Middle Aged Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate / drug effects Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate / physiology* Schizophrenia / physiopathology* Schizophrenic Psychology*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Targeted cognitive training (TCT) has been reported to improve verbal learning deficits in patients with schizophrenia (SZ). Despite positive findings, it is not clear whether demographic factors and clinical characteristics contribute to the success of TCT on an individual basis. Medication-associated anticholinergic burden has been shown to impact TCT-associated verbal learning gains in SZ outpatients, but the role of anticholinergic medication burden on TCT gains in treatment refractory SZ patients has not been described. In this study, SZ patients mandated to a locked residential rehabilitation center were randomized to treatment as usual (TAU; n=22) or a course of TAU augmented with TCT (n=24). Anticholinergic medication burden was calculated from medication data at baseline and follow-up using the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) Scale. MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery Verbal Learning domain scores were used as the primary outcome variable. The TAU and TCT groups were matched in ACB at baseline and follow-up. While baseline ACB was not associated with verbal learning in either group, increases in ACB over the course of the study were significantly associated with deterioration of verbal learning in the TAU group (r=-0.51, p=0.02). This was not seen in subjects randomized to TCT (r=-0.13, p=0.62). Our results suggest that TCT may blunt anticholinergic medication burden associated reduction in verbal learning in severely disabled SZ inpatients.Adult Cholinergic Antagonists / adverse effects* Cholinergic Antagonists / therapeutic use Cognition Disorders / rehabilitation* Cognitive Behavioral Therapy / methods* Female Humans Male Rehabilitation Centers Schizophrenia / rehabilitation* Schizophrenic Psychology* Verbal Learning / drug effects*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Speech disturbances are well-known symptoms contributing to the diagnosis of schizophrenia. Subanesthetic doses of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist ketamine have been reported to produce positive and negative symptoms and cognitive impairments consistent with those seen in schizophrenia. Insofar as this is true, it constitutes evidence that the NMDA system is involved in schizophrenia. It is therefore of interest to know whether ketamine produces speech disturbances like those of schizophrenia. Quantitative computer-aided analysis of apparently normal speech can detect clinically relevant changes and differences that are not noticeable to the human observer. Accordingly, in this study, speech samples were analysed for repetitiousness, idea density, and verb density using software developed by the authors. The samples came from two experiments, a within-subjects study of healthy volunteers given intravenous ketamine versus placebo, and a between-groups study of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and comparable healthy controls.Our primary hypothesis was that in both schizophrenia and ketamine, repetitiousness would increase, since perserverative speech is a well-known symptom of schizophrenia. Our secondary hypotheses were that in both schizophrenia and ketamine, idea density and verb density would decrease as indicators of cognitive impairment. The primary hypothesis was confirmed in the schizophrenia experiment (between groups) and the ketamine experiment (within subjects). The secondary hypotheses were disconfirmed except that in the ketamine experiment, verb density was significantly lowered. Reduced use of verbs apparently reflects a cognitive impairment of a different type than repetitiousness, and further investigation is needed to determine whether this impairment occurs in psychosis.Adult Cross-Over Studies Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Double-Blind Method Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists / pharmacology* Female Hallucinogens* Humans Ketamine / pharmacology* Male Psychoses, Substance-Induced / psychology* Sample Size Schizophrenic Language*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Glutamatergic dysfunction may play an important role in both the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, and impaired memory commonly observed in that disorder. NMDA receptor antagonists impair learning/memory in animal models, putatively based on its ability to block long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. Although well studied in animal models, research in humans is limited and confounded by administration of NMDA antagonists before the learning experience. Based on presumed glutamatergic dysfunction, it was predicted that the NMDA antagonist ketamine would not effect memory in schizophrenic subjects. Bolus injections of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo were given to seven patients with schizophrenia in this double-blind cross-over study. Immediately prior to injection, subjects were administered verbal and figural memory tests. Delayed recalls were obtained 30-45 min postinjection. In order to rule out drug-induced generalized cognitive impairments, other cognitive tasks were administered pre- and postinjection. The results indicate no differences between the drug and placebo conditions for either memory task, and no changes on the other cognitive tasks observed.Adult Cognition / drug effects* Cross-Over Studies Double-Blind Method Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists / pharmacology* Female Humans Ketamine / pharmacology* Male Memory / drug effects* Schizophrenia / physiopathology*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "It is well documented that 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptors are involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and cognitive impairment. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of ondansetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist as an adjuvant agent in the treatment of chronic schizophrenia in particular for cognitive impairments. This investigation was a 12-week, double blind study of parallel groups of patients with stable chronic schizophrenia. Thirty patients were recruited from inpatient and outpatient departments. All participants met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for schizophrenia. To be eligible, patients were required to have been treated with a stable dose of risperidone as their primary antipsychotic treatment for a minimum period of 8 weeks. The subjects were randomized to receive ondansetron (8 mg/day) or the placebo in addition to risperidone. Clinical psychopathology was assessed with Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Cognition was measured by a cognitive battery. Patients were assessed at baseline and after 8, and 12 weeks after the medication started. The PANSS scores and cognitive performance were used as the outcome measures. The ondansetron group had significantly greater improvement in the negative symptoms, general psychopathological symptoms and PANSS total scores over the trial. Administration of ondansetron significantly improved visual memory based on improvement on visual reproduction, visual paired associate and figural memory sub tests of Wechsler Memory Scale--Revised. The present study indicates ondansetron as potential adjunctive treatment strategy for chronic schizophrenia particularly for negative symptoms and cognitive impairments.Adult Antipsychotic Agents / administration & dosage* Antipsychotic Agents / adverse effects Case-Control Studies Chronic Disease Cognition Disorders / diagnosis Cognition Disorders / drug therapy Cognition Disorders / psychology Double-Blind Method Drug Therapy, Combination Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Male Neuropsychological Tests Ondansetron / administration & dosage* Ondansetron / adverse effects Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Risperidone / administration & dosage Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Schizophrenic Psychology* Serotonin Antagonists / administration & dosage* Serotonin Antagonists / adverse effects Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

Changes in perception and behaviors associated with dissociative states were assessed by the Perceptual Aberration Subscale of the Wisconsin Psychosis Proneness Scale and the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale. Cognitive function was assessed by using the (1) Mini-Mental State Examination; (2) tests sensitive to frontal cortical dysfunction, including a continuous performance vigilance task, a verbal fluency task, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; and (3) tests of immediate and delayed recall. Plasma levels of cortisol, prolactin, homovanillic acid, and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol were measured.\n",
      "Ketamine (1) produced behaviors similar to the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia; (2) elicited alterations in perception; (3) impaired performance on tests of vigilance, verbal fluency, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; (4) evoked symptoms similar to dissociative states; and (5) preferentially disrupted delayed word recall, sparing immediate recall and postdistraction recall. Ketamine had no significant effect on the Mini-Mental State Examination at the doses studied. Ketamine also had no effect on plasma 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol levels, although it blunted a test day decline in plasma homovanillic acid levels at the higher dose. It also dose dependently increased plasma cortisol and prolactin levels. Ketamine produced small dose-dependent increases in blood pressure.\n",

      "Treating patients who experience residual psychotic symptoms during remission of schizophrenia remains one of the most challenging problems. The mechanisms underlying these symptoms differ from those of acute hallucinations and delusions. 5-HT6 receptor antagonists have been considered promising agents in treatment of residual psychotic symptoms and cognitive dysfunction. The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of a selective 5-HT6 inhibitor Avisetron in the reduction of residual psychotic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia on stable antipsychotic therapy.\n",
      "Eighty clinically stable outpatient subjects with schizophrenia with residual psychotic symptoms were randomized in a double-blind manner to 6 weeks of Avisetron or placebo at 1:1 ratio. Subjects received 8 mg of Avisetron or placebo on top their stable antipsychotic treatment. Standard clinical scales and cognitive tests were used for endpoint assessment. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean reduction of total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale score after 6 weeks of treatment.\n",
      "No significant differences in the primary and secondary endpoints were found between the groups. However, based on the subgroup analysis, the significant improvement of total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale score and residual psychotic symptoms was observed in female patients.\n",
      "It was a negative study with unexpected benefits of the drug only in females. We hypothesized that the role of patients' sex can impact the treatment response to serotonergic drugs in general. We suggest a possible synergistic interaction between estrogen and Avisetron by means of modulating the effect of estrogens on the serotonergic system. Future studies targeting the sex-related effects of serotonergic drugs are warranted.Adult Double-Blind Method Drug Therapy, Combination Female Flavonoids / therapeutic use* Humans Male Middle Aged Outcome Assessment, Health Care* Psychotic Disorders / drug therapy* Receptors, Serotonin* Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Serotonin Antagonists / administration & dosage Serotonin Antagonists / pharmacology* Sex FactorsQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Dysfunction of neuroplasticity due to N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor hypofunction may be a causal factor for memory and executive dysfunctioning in schizophrenia. Deregulation of NMDA transmission in the prefrontal cortex may also explain negative and positive symptoms. Clozapine augmentation with memantine targets altered NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission in schizophrenia and showed substantial beneficial effects on several symptom domains in a small proof-of-concept study. We evaluate effects of memantine add-on treatment to clozapine for memory and executive function, and negative and positive symptoms in schizophrenia.\n",
      "Clozapine-treated patients with refractory schizophrenia were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of double-blind adjunctive treatment with memantine (n = 26) or placebo (n = 26). Crossover occurred after a 2-week placebo wash-out period. Primary endpoints were change from baseline to 12 weeks treatment and 14 weeks to 26 weeks treatment on memory and executive function using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale (CGI-S). Side effects were assessed using the Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side-Effect Rating Scale.\n",
      "When compared with placebo, memantine improved a composite memory score comprising verbal recognition memory and paired associates learning task scores on the CANTAB (effect size = 0.30) and PANSS negative subscale score (effect size = 0.29). Side effects were mild and transient.\n",
      "In patients with clozapine-treated refractory schizophrenia, memantine addition significantly improved verbal and visual memory and negative symptoms without serious adverse effects. These results justify further investigations on long-term memantine augmentation to clozapine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia.Adult Antipsychotic Agents / administration & dosage Antipsychotic Agents / pharmacology* Clozapine / administration & dosage Clozapine / pharmacology* Cognitive Dysfunction / drug therapy* Cognitive Dysfunction / etiology Cross-Over Studies Double-Blind Method Drug Resistance Drug Therapy, Combination Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists / administration & dosage Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists / pharmacology* Female Humans Male Memantine / administration & dosage Memantine / pharmacology* Memory Disorders / drug therapy* Memory Disorders / etiology Middle Aged Outcome Assessment, Health Care Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / drug therapy*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Abnormalities in cortical excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance are thought to underlie sensory and information processing deficits in schizophrenia. Deficits in early auditory information processing mediate both neurocognitive and functional impairment and appear to be normalized by acute pharmacologic challenge with the NMDA antagonist memantine (MEM).\n",
      "Thirty-six subjects with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and 31 healthy control subjects underwent electroencephalographic recordings. Subjects ingested either placebo or MEM (10 or 20 mg) in a double-blind, within-subject, crossover, randomized design. The aperiodic, 1/f-like scaling property of the neural power spectra, which is thought to index relative E/I balance, was estimated using a robust linear regression algorithm.\n",
      "Patients with schizophrenia had greater aperiodic components compared with healthy control subjects (p < .01, d = 0.64), which was normalized after 20 mg MEM. Analysis revealed a significant dose × diagnosis interaction (p < .0001, d = 0.82). Furthermore, the MEM effect (change in aperiodic component in MEM vs. placebo conditions) was associated with baseline attention and vigilance (r = .54, p < .05) and MEM-induced enhancements in gamma power (r = -.60, p < .01).\n",
      "Findings confirmed E/I balance abnormalities in schizophrenia that were normalized with acute MEM administration and suggest that neurocognitive profiles may predict treatment response based on E/I sensitivity.

      "The uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine has been proposed to model symptoms of psychosis. Smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM) are an established biomarker of schizophrenia. SPEM performance has been shown to be impaired in the schizophrenia spectrum and during ketamine administration in healthy volunteers. However, the neural mechanisms mediating SPEM impairments during ketamine administration are unknown. In a counter-balanced, placebo-controlled, double-blind, within-subjects design, 27 healthy participants received intravenous racemic ketamine (100 ng/mL target plasma concentration) on one of two assessment days and placebo (intravenous saline) on the other. Participants performed a block-design SPEM task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 3 Tesla field strength. Self-ratings of psychosis-like experiences were obtained using the Psychotomimetic States Inventory (PSI). Ketamine administration induced psychosis-like symptoms, during ketamine infusion, participants showed increased ratings on the PSI dimensions cognitive disorganization, delusional thinking, perceptual distortion and mania. Ketamine led to robust deficits in SPEM performance, which were accompanied by reduced blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in the SPEM network including primary visual cortex, area V5 and the right frontal eye field (FEF), compared to placebo. A measure of connectivity with V5 and FEF as seed regions, however, was not significantly affected by ketamine. These results are similar to the deviations found in schizophrenia patients. Our findings support the role of glutamate dysfunction in impaired smooth pursuit performance and the use of ketamine as a pharmacological model of psychosis, especially when combined with oculomotor biomarkers.

      "Targeting glutamatergic dysfunction provides an exciting opportunity to improve cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. One treatment approach has targeted inadequate antioxidant defenses at glutamatergic synapses. Animal and human data suggest NMDA antagonists worsen executive cognitive controls--e.g. increase perseverative responses and impair set-shifting. We conducted a preliminary study to test the hypothesis that L-carnosine, an antioxidant and anti-glycation agent which is co-localized and released with glutamate would improve executive dysfunction, a cognitive domain associated with glutamate.\n",
      "Seventy-five symptomatically stable adults with chronic schizophrenia were randomly assigned to L-carnosine as adjunctive treatment (2 g/day) or a matched placebo in a double-blind manner for 3 months. Cognitive domains (executive dysfunction, memory, attention and motor speed) were assessed using a computerized battery at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks, along with psychopathology ratings and safety parameters.\n",
      "The L-carnosine group performed significantly faster on non-reversal condition trials of the set-shifting test compared with placebo but reversal reaction times and errors were not significantly different between treatments. On the strategic target detection test, the L-carnosine group displayed significantly improved strategic efficiency and made fewer perseverative errors compared with placebo. Other cognitive tests showed no significant differences between treatments. Psychopathology scores remained stable. The carnosine group reported more adverse events (30%) compared with the placebo group (14%). Laboratory indices remained within acceptable ranges.\n",

Antipsychotics offer an effective treatment for positive symptoms, while the negative signs and cognitive deficits are usually treatment-resistant. It was suggested that glutamate dysregulation may be involved in the neuropathology of schizophrenia, mainly through NMDA dysfunction.

      "Aberrant gamma-band (30-80 Hz) oscillations may underlie cognitive deficits in schizophrenia (SZ). Gamma oscillations and their regulation by NMDA receptors can be studied via their evoked power (γEP) and phase locking (γPL) in response to auditory steady-state stimulation; these auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) may be biomarkers for target engagement and early therapeutic effects. We previously reported that memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, enhanced two biomarkers of early auditory information processing: prepulse inhibition and mismatch negativity (MMN) in SZ patients and healthy subjects (HS). Here, we describe memantine effects on γEP and γPL in those subjects. SZ patients (n=18) and HS (n=14) received memantine 20 mg (p.o.) and placebo over 2 test days in a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced, cross-over design. The ASSR paradigm (1 ms, 85 dB clicks in 250-0.5 s trains at a frequency of 40 Hz; 0.5 s inter-train interval) was used to assess γEP and γPL. SZ patients had reduced γEP and γPL; memantine enhanced γEP and γPL (p<0.025 and 0.002, respectively) in both SZ and HS. In patients, significant correlations between age and memantine effects were detected for γEP and γPL: greater memantine sensitivity on γEP and γPL were present in younger SZ patients, similar to our reported findings with MMN. Memantine acutely normalized cortical oscillatory dynamics associated with NMDA receptor dysfunction in SZ patients. Ongoing studies will clarify whether these acute changes predict beneficial clinical, neurocognitive and functional outcomes. These data support the use of gamma-band ASSR as a translational end point in pro-cognitive drug discovery and early-phase clinical trials.Adult Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use* Auditory Perception / drug effects Auditory Perception / physiology Chronic Disease Cortical Synchronization / drug effects Cortical Synchronization / physiology Cross-Over Studies Depressive Disorder / drug therapy Depressive Disorder / physiopathology Double-Blind Method Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists / therapeutic use* Female Gamma Rhythm / drug effects* Gamma Rhythm / physiology Humans Male Memantine / therapeutic use* Middle Aged Prepulse Inhibition / drug effects* Prepulse Inhibition / physiology Psychotic Disorders / drug therapy Psychotic Disorders / physiopathology Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate / antagonists & inhibitors Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate / metabolism Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Schizophrenia / physiopathology Treatment Outcome Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists have been demonstrated to induce schizophrenia-like symptoms and cognitive impairment in humans. The NMDA receptor has been strongly implicated in memory, but research to date on the effects of NMDA antagonists has examined only some aspects of human memory functions. This study used a double-blind, placebo-controlled, independent groups design with 54 healthy volunteers to examine the effects of infusions of two doses (0.4, 0.8 mg/kg) of the NMDA antagonist ketamine upon the five human memory systems, aspects of executive functioning and schizophrenia-like and dissociative symptoms. Ketamine produced a dose-dependent impairment to episodic and working memory and a slowing of semantic processing. Ketamine also impaired recognition memory and procedural learning. Attention, perceptual priming and executive functioning were not affected following the drug. In addition, ketamine induced schizophrenia-like and dissociative symptoms, which were not correlated with the cognitive measures. These data suggest that, in humans, ketamine produces a selective pattern of impairments to working, episodic, and procedural memory but not to perceptual priming, attention or aspects of executive functioning.Adolescent Adult Analysis of Variance Case-Control Studies Cognition / drug effects* Comprehension / drug effects Dissociative Disorders / chemically induced Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists / adverse effects Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists / pharmacology* Female Humans Ketamine / adverse effects Ketamine / pharmacology* Language Tests Male Memory / drug effects* Reaction Time / drug effects Schizophrenic Psychology* Semantics Surveys and QuestionnairesQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "PF-03463275 at 10, 20, 40, and 60 mg twice a day produced ∼44%, 61%, 76%, and 83% GlyT1 occupancy, respectively, in SZs with higher ligand binding to GlyT1 in subcortical versus cortical regions. PF-03463275 did not attenuate any ketamine-induced effects but did improve working memory accuracy in healthy control subjects. PF-03463275 increased long-term potentiation only in SZs with peak effects at 40 mg twice a day (∼75% GlyT1 occupancy) and with a profile suggestive of an inverted U dose response.

      "Antipsychotic drugs exert antipsychotic effects by blocking dopamine D2 receptors in the treatment of schizophrenia. However, effects of D2 receptor blockade on neurocognitive function still remain to be elucidated. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate impacts of estimated dopamine D2 receptor occupancy with antipsychotic drugs on several domains of neurocognitive function in patients with schizophrenia in the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials in Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) trial.\n",
      "The dataset from the CATIE trial was used in the present analysis. Data were extracted from 410 subjects who were treated with risperidone, olanzapine, or ziprasidone, received assessments for neurocognitive functions (verbal memory, vigilance, processing speed, reasoning, and working memory) and psychopathology, and provided plasma samples for the measurement of plasma antipsychotic concentrations. D2 receptor occupancy levels on the day of neurocognitive assessment were estimated from plasma antipsychotic concentrations, using population pharmacokinetic analysis and our recently developed model. A multivariate general linear model was used to examine effects of clinical and demographic characteristics, including estimated D2 occupancy levels, on neurocognitive functions.\n",
      "D2 occupancy levels showed significant associations with the vigilance and the summary scores. Neurocognitive functions, including vigilance, were especially impaired in subjects who showed D2 receptor occupancy level of >77%.\n",
      "These findings suggest a nonlinear relationship between prescribed antipsychotic doses and overall neurocognitive function and vigilance. This study shows that D2 occupancy above approximately 80% not only increases the risk for extrapyramidal side effects as consistently reported in the literature but also increases the risk for cognitive impairment.Adolescent Adult Antipsychotic Agents / metabolism* Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use Benzodiazepines / metabolism Benzodiazepines / therapeutic use Cognition Disorders / metabolism* Cognition Disorders / psychology Dopamine D2 Receptor Antagonists* Female Humans Linear Models Male Middle Aged Olanzapine Piperazines / metabolism Piperazines / therapeutic use Receptors, Dopamine D2 Risperidone / metabolism Risperidone / therapeutic use Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Schizophrenic Psychology* Thiazoles / metabolism Thiazoles / therapeutic use Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "There is evidence that blockade of 5-HT 6 receptors can improve cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenic patients. A number of antagonists of 5-HT6 receptors are in development as cognitive enhancers. One of the agents with relatively strong 5-HT6 activity is dimebon. We tested the hypothesis that this 5-HT6 antagonist administered in the early stage of stabilization after an acute episode can improve both neurocognitive and clinical symptoms in schizophrenia. A phase II study of dimebon as add-on to risperidone therapy was conducted.\n",
      "56 male subjects with paranoid schizophrenia were included in the study. All the patients demonstrated therapeutic response to risperidone as treatment of the acute psychotic episode. After 4 weeks of stability patients were randomized into two groups with placebo or dimebon add-on treatment in a 1 to 1 ratio for 8 weeks. PANSS, CGI-S, CSDS and NSA-16 were used as clinical measures of symptom severity. Different aspects of memory, psycho-motor coordination and executive functioning were assessed with a battery of cognitive tests. Clinical and cognitive assessment was performed twice: after a patient was randomized and 2 months later.\n",
      "Severity of negative symptoms (by NSA-16) were significantly lower in the dimebon group then in the placebo group (p=0.036).

      "Evidence from histological and pharmacological challenge studies indicates that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor hypofunction may play an important role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Our goal was to characterize effects of NMDA hypofunction further, as related to schizophrenia-associated neuropsychological impairment. We administered progressively higher doses of ketamine (target plasma concentrations of 50, 100, 150, and 200 ng/ml) to 10 psychiatrically healthy young men in a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled design and assessed oculomotor, cognitive, and symptomatic changes. Mean ketamine plasma concentrations approximated target plasma concentrations at each infusion step. Verbal recall, recognition memory, verbal fluency, pursuit tracking, visually guided saccades, and fixation all deteriorated significantly during ketamine infusion; lateral gaze nystagmus explained some, but not all, of the smooth pursuit abnormalities. We concluded that ketamine induces changes in recall and recognition memory and verbal fluency reminiscent of schizophreniform psychosis. During smooth pursuit eye tracking, ketamine induces nystagmus as well as abnormalities characteristic of schizophrenia. These findings help delineate the similarities and differences between schizophreniform and NMDA-blockade-induced cognitive and oculomotor abnormalities.Adult Affect / drug effects Cognition / drug effects Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists / blood Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists / pharmacology* Eye Movements / drug effects* Humans Ketamine / blood Ketamine / pharmacology* Male Memory / drug effects Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate / antagonists & inhibitors* Single-Blind MethodQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "• Several lines of evidence suggest a possible role of 5-HT(6) receptor antagonists in dementia or cognitive dysfunction of schizophrenia. SB-742457 is a potent 5-HT(6) antagonist and has shown efficacy in different animal models of cognitive impairment. It is currently in development as a cognitive enhancer. Risperidone, commonly used to control agitation and psychotic features in both schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, is a D(2)/5-HT(2A ) antagonist with low affinity for 5-HT(6) receptors and limited effects on cognitive parameters.\n",
      "• As the combination of risperidone and SB-742457 may constitute a reasonable combination in cognitively impaired patients, pharmacodynamic interaction effects were investigated in this study. The only significant drug-drug interaction was a small increase of electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha and beta bands, which might suggest mild arousing activity of SB-742457 on the central nervous system-depressant effects of risperidone. The clinical relevance of these findings in patients remains to be established. Additionally, this study provided an extensive multidimensional pharmacodynamic profile of risperidone in healthy volunteers, showing that this antipsychotic suppresses motor performance (eye-hand coordination, finger tapping and postural stability), alertness, memory and neurophysiological functions (saccadic eye movements and EEG power spectrum).\n",
      "Several lines of evidence suggest a possible role of 5-HT(6 ) receptor antagonists in cognitive dysfunction of schizophrenia. Atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone, are currently used in these disorders. Therefore, the pharmacological interactions between the 5-HT(6) antagonist SB-742457 and risperidone were investigated in the light of possible co-medication.\n",
      "A randomized, double-blind, two-way crossover design was used to study the interaction between multiple doses SB-742457 50 mg and a single dose risperidone 2 mg in 18 healthy subjects.\n",
      "Treatment was well tolerated. The most common adverse event was somnolence in 83% during the combination vs. 50% of subjects after risperidone, 32% after placebo and 11% after SB-742457. Combination treatment produced a statistically significant increase in the maximum plasma concentration of risperidone and had no effect on SB-742457 pharmacokinetics. Risperidone decreased saccadic peak velocity, finger tapping, adaptive tracking, subjective alertness, delayed word recognition and body sway and increased electroencephalogram (EEG) theta power and prolactin. The only pharmacodynamic interaction of risperidone and SB-742457 was an increase of absolute EEG alpha (ratio = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.11, 1.40, P= 0.0004) and beta power (ratio = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.27, P= 0.016). No significant effects of SB-742457 alone were found.\n",
      "The pharmacokinetic interactions between SB-742457 and risperidone detected in this study were not clinically relevant. The increase in EEG alpha and beta power is incompatible with enhanced risperidone activity, but could point to mild arousing effects of the combination. Most pharmacodynamic changes of risperidone are consistent with previously reported data.

      "First generation antipsychotics induce extrapyramidal motor symptoms (EPS), presumably through dopamine D(2) receptor blockade at the dorsal striatum. This may also produce impairment of cognitive processes, such as procedural learning, that are dependent on this region. Haloperidol and, to a lesser extent, risperidone, are active in the dorsal striatum and may induce EPS and impairment of procedural learning. In contrast, the prototypical second-generation antipsychotic, clozapine, is less active in the dorsal striatum and does not induce EPS or impair procedural learning. Olanzapine is pharmacologically similar to clozapine and has a low incidence of EPS induction.\n",

      "Ketamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist with psychotogenic and dissociative effects in healthy humans. These cognitive and perceptual effects in humans are reportedly reduced by benzodiazepine premedication. This study assessed the interactive effects of a ketamine (i.v. bolus of 0.26 mg/kg followed by an infusion of 0.65 mg/kg per hour) and lorazepam 2 mg., PO, in humans. Twenty-three healthy subjects completed 4 test days involving the oral administration of lorazepam or matched placebo 2 h prior to the i.v. infusion of ketamine or placebo. Ketamine: 1) produced behaviors similar to the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia as assessed by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS); 2) evoked perceptual alterations as measured by the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS); 3) impaired performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and other tests sensitive to frontal cortical impairment; and 4) had amnestic effects. Lorazepam produced attention impairments, concrete proverb interpretations, and recall impairments. Lorazepam reduced ketamine-associated emotional distress and there was a non-significant trend for it to decrease perceptual alterations produced by ketamine. However, it failed to reduce many cognitive and behavioral effects of ketamine, including psychosis. Further, lorazepam exacerbated the sedative, attention-impairing, and amnestic effects of ketamine. There was no evidence of pharmacokinetic interaction between these medications. These data suggest that subhypnotic lorazepam and ketamine show a spectrum of interactive effects, ranging from antagonism to potentiation.Adult Anesthetics, Intravenous / adverse effects Anesthetics, Intravenous / pharmacokinetics Anesthetics, Intravenous / pharmacology* Anti-Anxiety Agents / adverse effects Anti-Anxiety Agents / pharmacokinetics Anti-Anxiety Agents / pharmacology* Arousal / drug effects Attention / drug effects Cognition / drug effects Double-Blind Method Drug Interactions Female Hormones / blood Humans Ketamine / adverse effects Ketamine / pharmacokinetics Ketamine / pharmacology* Learning / drug effects Lorazepam / adverse effects Lorazepam / pharmacokinetics Lorazepam / pharmacology* Male Memory / drug effects Mental Processes / drug effects* Psychiatric Status Rating ScalesQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "The development of therapeutic strategies for cognitive dysfunction remains one of the primary goals in the treatment of schizophrenia. The pharmacodynamic profile of mirtazapine, an antidepressant that enhances noradrenergic and serotonergic transmission, is based on a presynaptic alpha2 antagonism and postsynaptic 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 antagonism. Mirtazapine shares some pharmacological similarities with that of clozapine. This 8-week open label trial aimed to discover whether the addition of 30 mg mirtazapine could potentiate the effects on cognition of an ongoing stabilized clozapine therapy in 15 persons who met the criteria for chronic schizophrenia in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.; American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Mirtazapine adjunction was well tolerated and induced a significant improvement in cognitive performance, as measured by the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; Randolph, 1998) total score and by the subscales for immediate and delayed memory (p<.01). Since Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D; Hamilton, 1967), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS; Overall & Gorham, 1962), and Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS; Andreasen, 1989) scores at Week 8 did not show significant differences from baseline, the improvements in the effects of clozapine on cognition observed after the addition of mirtazapine seemed to be a direct rather than an indirect action of this drug (e.g., via mood or other psychopathological symptoms). These findings suggest a potential role for mirtazapine as a useful strategy to augment the efficacy of clozapine in the treatment of cognitive dysfunctions in chronic schizophrenia.Administration, Oral Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists / administration & dosage Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists / therapeutic use Adult Antipsychotic Agents / administration & dosage Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale Chronic Disease Clozapine / administration & dosage Clozapine / therapeutic use* Cognition / drug effects* Cognition Disorders / drug therapy Cognition Disorders / physiopathology Cognition Disorders / psychology Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Drug Synergism Female Humans Male Mianserin / administration & dosage Mianserin / analogs & derivatives* Mianserin / therapeutic use Mirtazapine Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Schizophrenia / physiopathology Time FactorsQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "The cognitive, behavioral, and mood effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, such as phencyclidine and ketamine, have been used to study the effects of NMDA receptor dysfunction. Pharmacological modulation of the effects of NMDA receptor antagonists, such as ketamine, may lead to development of novel therapeutic agents for psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia. Preclinical studies indicate that some ketamine effects may be mediated through increased glutamate release. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that lamotrigine, a drug reported to inhibit glutamate release, will reduce the neuropsychiatric effects of ketamine in humans.\n",
      "Healthy subjects (n = 16) completed 4 test days involving the administration of lamotrigine, 300 mg by mouth, or placebo 2 hours prior to administration of ketamine (0.26 mg/kg by intravenous bolus and 0.65 mg/kg per hour by intravenous infusion) or placebo in a randomized order under double-blind conditions. Behavioral and cognitive assessments were performed at baseline and after administration of the medications.\n",
      "Lamotrigine significantly decreased ketamine-induced perceptual abnormalities as assessed by the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (P<.001); positive symptoms of schizophrenia as assessed by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale positive symptoms subscale (P<.001); negative symptoms as assessed by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale negative symptoms subscale (P<.05); and learning and memory impairment as assessed by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (P<.05). However, lamotrigine increased the immediate mood-elevating effects of ketamine (P<.05).\n",

Shortcomings of most previous investigations include failure to maintain steady-state infusion conditions, test multiple doses and/or measure antagonist plasma concentrations. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, within-subjects comparison of three fixed subanesthetic, steady-state doses of intravenous ketamine in healthy males (n = 15) demonstrated dose-dependent increases in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale positive (F[3,42] = 21.84; p < 0.0001) and negative symptoms (F[3,42] = 2.89; p = 0.047), and Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) total scores (F[3,42] = 10.55; p < 0.0001). Ketamine also produced a robust dose-dependent decrease in verbal declarative memory performance (F[3,41] = 5.11; p = 0.004), and preliminary evidence for a similar dose-dependent decrease in nonverbal declarative memory, occurring at or below plasma concentrations producing other symptoms.

      "The effects of the selective inhibitor of the glycine transporter 1, R231857, in development for schizophrenia, on the central nervous system (CNS) were investigated in healthy males in the absence and presence of scopolamine. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-period crossover ascending dose study. Pharmacokinetics, body sway, saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movements, pupillometry, pharmacoelectroencephalogram (EEG), Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) for alertness, mood, calmness and psychedelic effects, adaptive tracking, finger tapping, Stroop test, Visual and Verbal Learning Task (VVLT) and hormone levels were assessed. R231857 was administered alone and together with scopolamine to investigate the potential reversal of anticholinergic CNS impairment by the glycine reuptake inhibitor. Forty-two of the 45 included subjects completed the study. Scopolamine significantly affected almost every CNS parameter measured in this study. R231857 alone showed some pharmacodynamic changes compared with placebo. Although these effects might be an indication that R231857 penetrated the CNS, they were not consistent or dose-related. R231857 had some small effects on scopolamine-induced CNS-impairment, which were also not clearly dependent on dose. Scopolamine proved to be an accurate, reproducible and safe model to induce CNS impairment by an anticholinergic mechanism. R231857 lacked consistent dose-related effects in this study, probably because CNS concentrations were too low to produce significant/ reproducible CNS-effects or to affect the scopolamine challenge in healthy volunteers. The effects of higher doses in healthy volunteers and the clinical efficacy in patients remain to be established.Adult Affect / drug effects Attention / drug effects Central Nervous System / drug effects* Cognition / drug effects Cross-Over Studies Double-Blind Method Electroencephalography / drug effects Furans / adverse effects Furans / pharmacokinetics* Furans / pharmacology* Glycine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins / antagonists & inhibitors* Humans Male Middle Aged Psychomotor Disorders / chemically induced* Psychomotor Performance / drug effects Pursuit, Smooth / drug effects Receptors, Glycine / metabolism* Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate / metabolism Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Scopolamine / pharmacology* Thiophenes / adverse effects Thiophenes / pharmacokinetics* Thiophenes / pharmacology* Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "The objective of the study was to measure the DA D2 receptor occupancy of sulpiride 200 and 400 mg and relate this to changes in task performance.\n",
      "Positron emission tomography scans were acquired in ten healthy volunteers with [11C]-raclopride.

      "Striatal sulpiride occupancy was approximately 17% (200 mg) and approximately 28% (400 mg), with similar occupancy within the midbrain.

Accuracy on the spatial working memory and spatial learning tasks was impaired after the drug, and the former was inversely related to occupancy.\n",
      "Doses of sulpiride typically used in human cognitive studies produced low levels of DA D2 receptor occupancy compared to that considered efficacious in the treatment of schizophrenia. The levels of occupancy were sufficient to replicate impairments on a spatial working memory task and impair spatial learning. The relationship between occupancy and working memory was suggestive of presynaptic effects, although the precise mechanism underlying the impairment will require studies of wider ranges of occupancy within and outside of the striatum.Adult Affect / drug effects Antipsychotic Agents / pharmacology* Carbon Radioisotopes Corpus Striatum / diagnostic imaging Corpus Striatum / drug effects* Dopamine Antagonists Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Double-Blind Method Humans Male Memory, Short-Term / drug effects* Motor Activity / drug effects* Neuropsychological Tests Orientation / drug effects* Pain Measurement Pattern Recognition, Visual / drug effects* Positron-Emission Tomography* Probability Learning* Prolactin / blood Raclopride Reaction Time / drug effects Receptors, Dopamine D2 / drug effects* Serial Learning / drug effects* Sulpiride / pharmacology*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "In this study the effects of R213129, a selective glycine transporter 1 inhibitor, on central nervous system function were investigated in healthy males in the absence and presence of scopolamine. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-period crossover ascending dose study evaluating the following endpoints: body sway, saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movements, pupillometry, electroencephalography, visual analogue scales for alertness, mood, calmness and psychedelic effects, adaptive tracking, finger tapping, Visual and Verbal Learning Task, Stroop test, hormone levels and pharmacokinetics. R213129 dose levels were selected based on exposure levels that blocked the GlyT1 sites >50% in preclinical experiments. Forty-three of the 45 included subjects completed the study. Scopolamine significantly affected almost every central nervous system parameter measured in this study. R213129 alone compared with placebo did not elicit pharmacodynamic changes. R213129 had some small effects on scopolamine-induced central nervous system impairments. Scopolamine-induced finger tapping impairment was further enhanced by 3 mg R213129 with 2.0 taps/10 seconds (95% CI -4.0, -0.1), electroencephalography alpha power was increased by 10 mg R213129 with respectively 12.9% (0.7, 26.6%), scopolamine-induced impairment of the Stroop test was partly reversed by 10 mg R213129 with 59 milliseconds (-110, -7). Scopolamine produced robust and consistent effects in psychomotor and cognitive function in healthy volunteers. The most logical reason for the lack of R213129 effects seems to be that the central nervous system concentrations were too low. The effects of higher doses in healthy volunteers and the clinical efficacy in patients remain to be established.Adult Affect / drug effects Attention / drug effects Central Nervous System / drug effects* Cognition / drug effects Cross-Over Studies Double-Blind Method Electroencephalography / drug effects Furans / adverse effects Furans / pharmacokinetics* Furans / pharmacology* Glycine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins / antagonists & inhibitors* Humans Male Middle Aged Psychomotor Disorders / chemically induced* Psychomotor Performance / drug effects Pursuit, Smooth / drug effects Receptors, Glycine / metabolism* Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate / metabolism Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Scopolamine / pharmacology* Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Patients on placebo demonstrated broad deficits in task performance compared to the healthy comparison group, accompanied by preserved network activity for solution search, but reduced activity in left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and posterior parietal cortex for attentional set-shifting and reduced activity in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for reversal learning. These ROI deficits were ameliorated by 250 µg roflumilast, whereas during solution search 100 µg roflumilast reduced activity in the left orbitofrontal cortex, right DLPFC and bilateral PPC, which was associated with an improvement in formation of attentional sets.\n",

      "Relationships between altered prefrontal cortical dopamine, norepinephrine, and some of the cognitive impairments of schizophrenia support an approach for pharmacological remediation of cognitive symptoms through manipulations of prefrontal cortical dopamine and norepinephrine. Atomoxetine, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, produces a widespread increase in brain norepinephrine and a secondary and selective increase in prefrontal dopamine. Given this, we evaluated atomoxetine's cognitive effects in a pilot placebo-controlled trial in patients with schizophrenia. Moreover, a functional magnetic resonance imaging investigation was undertaken to assess the neural mechanisms underlying the cognitive effects of atomoxetine. Twenty participants with schizophrenia were randomized to treatment with placebo or atomoxetine 80 mg daily for an 8-week parallel-designed treatment trial. Cognitive performance was assessed with the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia. No significant cognitive improvement was associated with atomoxetine treatment. However, atomoxetine treatment was associated with significantly greater increases in working memory-related activation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal and left posterior cingulate cortices. The negative results of this study conflict with the effectiveness of amphetamine in enhancing the cognitive abilities of schizophrenic patients and may be related to the differential pattern of cortical activation and deactivation produced by amphetamine.Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors / administration & dosage* Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors / therapeutic use Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use* Atomoxetine Hydrochloride Cognition Disorders / drug therapy* Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Drug Therapy, Combination Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging Pilot Projects Propylamines / administration & dosage* Propylamines / therapeutic use Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Schizophrenic Psychology*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Although there have been several case reports suggesting the beneficial effect of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in the cognitive deficits seen in schizophrenia, controlled studies have revealed contradictory results. The aim of this study was to investigate if donepezil could improve cognitive functions in schizophrenia. Twelve schizophrenic patients, who were diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria and who had been on a stable dose of a high-potency typical antipsychotic for a minimum period of 3 months, participated in this 12-wk double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over study of donepezil adjunctive treatment. Patients were randomly assigned under double-blind conditions to receive 5 mg/d donepezil or placebo for 6 wk, and then were crossed over to the alternate condition for 6 additional weeks. At baseline, 6 and 12 wk, patients were evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Calgary Depression Scale, the Wechsler Memory Scale Revised (WMS-R), a test for Verbal Fluency, Trail Making Test, Parts A and B, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Treatment effect was not significant in any of the cognitive measures. There were also no significant changes in the PANSS and depression scores. Nicotinic receptor desensitization may cause non-responsiveness to acetylcholine as previously suggested, but the most likely explanation appears to be that defects in other neurotransmitter systems account for the cognitive deficits seen in schizophrenic patients.Adult Cognition Disorders / drug therapy* Cognition Disorders / etiology* Cross-Over Studies Donepezil Double-Blind Method Female Humans Indans / adverse effects Indans / therapeutic use* Male Memory / drug effects Neuropsychological Tests Nootropic Agents / adverse effects Nootropic Agents / therapeutic use* Piperidines / adverse effects Piperidines / therapeutic use* Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Schizophrenia / complications* Schizophrenic PsychologyQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Schizophrenia is associated with impairments in cognitive functioning yet there are no approved drugs to treat these deficits.\n",
      "Based on animal models, we investigated the potential for roflumilast, a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4), to improve cognition, which may act by increasing intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate in brain regions underlying cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.\n",
      "This study consisted of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design involving 15 schizophrenia patients. In 3 treatment periods, patients were given 8 days of placebo or one of the two doses of roflumilast (100 and 250 μg daily) with 14 days of washout between treatments. The primary endpoints were dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activation during a visuospatial working memory task measured with fMRI on dosing day 8 and verbal memory and working memory performance change from baseline to day 8. Least square mean change scores were calculated for behavioural outcomes; fMRI data were analysed in SPM12 with bilateral DLPFC as regions of interest.\n",
      "Verbal memory was significantly improved under 250 μg roflumilast (effect size (ES) = 0.77) compared to placebo. fMRI analyses revealed that increasing dose of roflumilast was associated with reduction of bilateral DLPFC activation during working memory compared to placebo, although this was not statistically significant (ES = 0.31 for the higher dose). Working memory was not improved (ES = 0.03).\n",
      "Results support the mechanistic validation of potential novel strategies for improving cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia and suggest that PDE4 inhibition may be beneficial for cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.\n",

      "Cognitive impairment has the greatest impact on illness outcome in schizophrenia. The most significant challenge in schizophrenia therapeutics, thus, is to develop an efficacious treatment for cognitive impairments. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as Physostigmine and Rivastigmine, are considered effective treatments for cognitive decline in Alzheimer's Disease, where the loss of cholinergic neurons is thought to be responsible for various cognitive deficits. The current study investigated the cognitive effects of Rivastigmine given as an add-on therapy to antipsychotic-treated schizophrenia patients in a placebo-controlled double-blind design. The study initially involved 40 patients, of which 21 patients (11 assigned to Rivastigmine and 10 assigned to placebo) agreed to continued participation, remained on the study drug, and underwent assessment of executive functioning, verbal skills, verbal and spatial working memory, attention and psychomotor speed on three occasions: (i) at baseline, and then (ii) after 12 weeks and (iii) 24 weeks of treatment with placebo or Rivastigmine. The results failed to reveal significant improvement on any cognitive measure with Rivastigmine treatment, compared with the placebo treatment. Some cognitive variables showed significant practice effects in both the placebo and Rivastigmine groups. No effects were noted in symptoms or side effects ratings. The beneficial cognitive effects of Rivastigmine seen in an open-label preliminary study are not substantiated by this study. Future studies should investigate the effects of other procholinergic drugs, such as Galantamine, which also act on the nicotine receptors and may produce stronger cognitive effects in schizophrenia.Adult Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use* Cholinesterase Inhibitors / pharmacology Cholinesterase Inhibitors / therapeutic use* Cognition Disorders / diagnosis Cognition Disorders / drug therapy* Cognition Disorders / epidemiology* Double-Blind Method Female Ganglionic Stimulants / pharmacology Ganglionic Stimulants / therapeutic use Humans Male Middle Aged Neuropsychological Tests Nicotine / pharmacology Nicotine / therapeutic use Phenylcarbamates / pharmacology Phenylcarbamates / therapeutic use* Physostigmine / pharmacology Physostigmine / therapeutic use Psychomotor Performance / drug effects Rivastigmine Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Schizophrenia / epidemiology* Severity of Illness Index Verbal Behavior / drug effectsQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) experience chronic cognitive deficits. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes that regulate cognitive circuitry; however, the role of HDACs in cognitive disorders, including SCZ, remains unknown in humans. We previously determined that HDAC2 mRNA levels were lower in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) tissue from donors with SCZ compared with controls. Here we investigated the relationship between in vivo HDAC expression and cognitive impairment in patients with SCZ and matched healthy controls using [11C]Martinostat positron emission tomography (PET).\n",
      "In a case-control study, relative [11C]Martinostat uptake was compared between 14 patients with SCZ or schizoaffective disorder (SCZ/SAD) and 17 controls using hypothesis-driven region-of-interest analysis and unbiased whole brain voxel-wise approaches. Clinical measures, including the MATRICS consensus cognitive battery, were administered.\n",
      "Relative HDAC expression was lower in the DLPFC of patients with SCZ/SAD compared with controls, and HDAC expression positively correlated with cognitive performance scores across groups. Patients with SCZ/SAD also showed lower relative HDAC expression in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal gyrus, and higher relative HDAC expression in the cerebral white matter, pons, and cerebellum compared with controls.\n",
      "These findings provide in vivo evidence of HDAC dysregulation in patients with SCZ and suggest that altered HDAC expression may impact cognitive function in humans.\n",

      "There have been many advancements in the pharmacologic treatment of schizophrenia; however, negative symptoms and cognitive impairment remain an intractable part of this illness. Donepezil is an anticholinesterase inhibitor with cognitive enhancing effects approved for the treatment of Alzheimer disease that has shown some benefit in the treatment of schizophrenia. In this study, 15 inpatients at a state hospital with a history of schizophrenia were administered donepezil in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. Neurocognitive testing and psychiatric ratings were completed at baseline and at regular intervals for 18 weeks. Results indicated that donepezil treatment was associated with modest improvements in psychiatric symptoms and improved verbal learning. These results suggest that donepezil may be helpful as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of psychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairment in a subgroup of schizophrenic patients.Acetylcholine / physiology Adult Cholinesterase Inhibitors / administration & dosage Cholinesterase Inhibitors / adverse effects Cholinesterase Inhibitors / therapeutic use* Cognition Disorders / drug therapy Cognition Disorders / etiology Cognition Disorders / psychology Cross-Over Studies Donepezil Double-Blind Method Female Humans Indans / administration & dosage Indans / adverse effects Indans / therapeutic use* Male Middle Aged Neuropsychological Tests Nootropic Agents / administration & dosage Nootropic Agents / adverse effects Nootropic Agents / therapeutic use* Piperidines / administration & dosage Piperidines / adverse effects Piperidines / therapeutic use* Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Schizophrenia / physiopathology Schizophrenic Psychology Verbal Learning / drug effectsQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

There was significant improvement in substance-related impairment among adolescents who responded to MDD treatment. Baseline suicidal ideation was higher among the subjects who progressed to high substance-related impairment (≥ 75th percentile) versus those whose substance-related impairment remained low (< 75th percentile), and parental depressive symptoms predicted persistence of high substance-related impairment during the study. The MDD response was best among the adolescents with low 12 week substance-related impairment scores regardless of whether they had high or low baseline substance-related impairment.

      "Patients with schizophrenia experience cognitive impairment related to neural network dysfunction and deficits in sensory processing. These deficits are thought to be caused by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor hypofunction and can be assessed in patient populations using electroencephalography (EEG). This substudy from a Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study investigating the safety and efficacy of the novel glycine transporter-1 inhibitor, iclepertin (BI 425809), assessed the potential of EEG parameters as clinically relevant biomarkers of schizophrenia and response to iclepertin treatment. Eligible patients were randomized to once-daily add-on iclepertin (2, 5, 10, or 25 mg), or placebo (1:1:1:1:2 ratio) for 12 weeks. EEG data were recorded from a subgroup of patients (n = 79) at baseline and end of treatment (EoT). EEG parameters of interest were mismatch negativity (MMN), auditory steady-state response (ASSR), and resting state gamma power, and their correlations with clinical assessments. At baseline, MMN and ASSR exhibited consistent correlations with clinical assessments, indicating their potential value as neurophysiological biomarkers of schizophrenia-related deficits. ASSR measures were positively correlated to the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery overall and neurocognitive composite scores; MMN amplitude was positively correlated with Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores. However, correlations between change from baseline (CfB) at EoT in clinical assessments, and baseline or CfB at EoT for EEG parameters were modest and inconsistent between dose groups, which might indicate low potential of these EEG parameters as predictive and treatment response biomarkers. Further methodological refinement is needed to establish EEG parameters as useful drug development tools for schizophrenia.Biomarkers Electroencephalography Evoked Potentials, Auditory / physiology Humans Organic Chemicals / therapeutic use Schizophrenia* / drug therapyQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Altered expression of central muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in hippocampal and cortical regions may contribute to the cognitive impairment exhibited in patients with schizophrenia. Increasing cholinergic activity through the use of a cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) therefore represents a possible strategy for cognitive augmentation in schizophrenia. We examined the efficacy and safety of the ChEI donepezil as cotreatment for mild to moderate cognitive impairment in schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in a prospective, 12-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study. In total, 250 patients (18-55 years) with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were clinically stabilized on risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, or aripiprazole, alone or in combination, were enrolled at 38 outpatient psychiatric clinics in the United States. Patients were randomized to donepezil 5 mg q.d. for 6 weeks then 10 mg q.d. for 6 weeks, or placebo administered as oral tablets. The primary outcome measure was the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) neurocognitive battery composite score. In the intent-to-treat sample (donepezil, n=121; placebo, n=124), both treatments showed improvement in the composite score from baseline to week 12. At week 12, cognitive improvement with donepezil was similar to that with placebo (last-observation-carried-forward effect size, 0.277 vs 0.411; p=0.1182) and statistically significantly inferior for the observed-cases analysis (0.257 vs 0.450; p=0.044). There was statistically significant improvement in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Assessment Scale negative symptoms score for placebo compared with donepezil, while total and positive symptom scores were similar between both treatments. Statistically significant improvements in positive symptoms score and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement for donepezil compared with placebo were noted at Week 6. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were observed for 54.5% of donepezil- and 61.3% of placebo-treated patients; most AEs were rated as mild to moderate in severity. Donepezil was safe and well-tolerated but was not effective compared with placebo as a cotreatment for the improvement of cognitive impairment in this patient population. A significant and surprisingly large placebo/practice effect was observed among placebo-treated patients, and is a serious consideration in future clinical trial study designs for potential cognitive enhancing compounds in schizophrenia.Adult Cholinesterase Inhibitors / therapeutic use* Clinical Trials as Topic Cognition Disorders / etiology Cognition Disorders / therapy* Donepezil Double-Blind Method Female Humans Indans / therapeutic use* Male Middle Aged Neuropsychological Tests Piperidines / therapeutic use* Placebo Effect* Practice, Psychological* Prospective Studies Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Psychotic Disorders / complications Psychotic Disorders / drug therapy Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / drug therapy Time FactorsQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "We sought to confirm and extend the findings of studies that reported that acetylcholinesterase inhibitor drugs protect against electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)-induced cognitive impairment. We randomized 30 patients with depression (n=24) or schizophrenia (n=6) to receive either donepezil (10 mg/day; n=15) or placebo (n=15) during a fixed course of 6 thrice-weekly, modified, bifrontotemporal sine wave ECT, and for 30 days subsequently. We assessed memory using the Postgraduate Institute Memory Scale (PGI-MS) at baseline, and again at days 2, 7, and 30 after the ECT course. At baseline, memory functioning was comparable in the 2 groups. At 2 days post-ECT, memory functioning was impaired on almost all 10 subtests and on the total scale. At 30 days post-ECT, memory functioning improved to (numerically) above baseline levels on almost all subtests and on the total scale, with the bulk of the improvement evident by day 7, itself. There was no significant difference between groups in the primary outcome, improvement in PGI-MS scores between Days 2 and 30 post-ECT. On almost all subtests, also, there was no significant difference between groups. In summary, we found that donepezil (10 mg/day) did not improve memory outcomes after ECT.Adult Cholinesterase Inhibitors / therapeutic use* Donepezil / therapeutic use* Double-Blind Method Electroconvulsive Therapy / adverse effects* Electroconvulsive Therapy / methods Female Humans Male Memory Disorders / drug therapy* Memory Disorders / etiology* Memory Disorders / psychology Mental Disorders / diagnosis Mental Disorders / psychology Mental Disorders / therapy* Middle Aged Nootropic Agents / therapeutic use Prospective Studies Treatment OutcomeQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Amelioration of cognitive impairment is an important treatment goal for a broad range of neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. One critical issue in clinical trial design is the extent to which repeated exposure to cognitive tests (i.e., practice effects) may lead to improvement in performance on the cognitive tests in the absence of any true treatment effect. The current study examined the extent to which practice effects on a measure of executive function may influence the sensitivity of that task to detecting the cognitive-enhancing effects of a single acute dose of d-amphetamine in individuals with chronic schizophrenia.\n",
      "Twenty-four men with chronic schizophrenia were randomized to receive a constant or random/matched alternate form version of a hidden maze learning measure of executive function (Groton Maze Learning Test; GMLT) on four separate occasions in one month. They also completed a measure of psychomotor speed. Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel groups design, cognitive function following administration of a single dose of d-amphetamine (20mg p.o) or placebo was then assessed.\n",
      "The group who received the constant-pathway version of the GMLT showed a large practice effect (d = 2.05) over four practice sessions. Consequently, they did not evidence any improvement on the GMLT following d-amphetamine administration. In contrast, the group who received the random/matched alternate version of the GMLT showed a statistically significant and large effect size (d = .84) improvement on this measure. Both groups showed d-amphetamine-related improvement on a measure of psychomotor speed.\n",

      "Facilitation of central cholinergic activity may form a potential treatment strategy for cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group design, we investigated the neural correlates of cognitive effects of rivastigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, given as an add-on therapy to antipsychotic-treated schizophrenia patients. Thirty-six chronic schizophrenia patients with mild cognitive impairment took part. After 1 week on placebo (baseline), all patients entered a double-blind protocol; 18 were allocated to receive rivastigmine and 18 placebo for the next 12 weeks (final sample with usable imaging data: 11 patients on rivastigmine, 10 on placebo). All patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during a parametric 'n-back' task, involving monitoring of dots in particular locations on a screen at a given delay from the original occurrence, twice: at baseline and 12 weeks post-rivastigmine/placebo treatment. Compared to placebo, rivastigmine produced only a small and non-significant improvement in task accuracy across all conditions with no change in response latency, and increased activity in the extrastriate visual cortex in areas associated with visual and spatial attention but not in any region within the working memory network. Our observations suggest that cholinergic enhancement with rivastigmine at doses known to be effective in Alzheimer's disease does not produce strong and clinically meaningful cognitive and neural changes in schizophrenia patients treated with atypical antipsychotics although the neural effects in terms of enhanced neuronal activity in regions associated with visual and spatial attention are consistent with those reported previously with cholinergic enhancement in healthy subjects.Adult Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use* Brain / pathology Cerebral Cortex / pathology Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Double-Blind Method Drug Therapy, Combination Female Humans Image Processing, Computer-Assisted Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Middle Aged Models, Statistical Neuroprotective Agents / therapeutic use* Phenylcarbamates / therapeutic use* Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Reaction Time / physiology Rivastigmine Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Schizophrenia / pathology* Smoking / pathologyQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Comorbid schizophrenia and dementia is becoming an increasingly common phenomenon. Because rivastigmine, a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, appears to delay the progression of Alzheimer's disease, it may also improve or delay the cognitive and behavioural disturbances evident in elderly chronic schizophrenia patients with comorbid cognitive decline. The aim of this study was to investigate augmentative rivastigmine administration in this population and to determine any effect on cognition, behaviour and 'activity of daily living' (ADLs) capabilities. Thirteen subjects with comorbid schizophrenia and dementia were administered open-label oral rivastigmine (9 mg/day) for a period of 12 weeks. The results indicated improvement in Mini-Mental State Examination scores (P<0.01), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale scores (P<0.001), ADL scores (P<0.01) and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores (P<0.01). Study observations indicate beneficial effects of rivastigmine administration in this subpopulation of schizophrenia patients. Following on from other studies of cholinesterase inhibitor agents, clinical improvement in this patient subpopulation may extend to the class of cholinesterase inhibitor agents in general and not necessarily be a specific effect of any of the medications. The effects noted may be specific to the subpopulation of comorbid schizophrenia and dementia rather than schizophrenia in general. Although speculative, these effects may be related to cholinergic dysfunction, which has been hypothesized to be present in some patients with schizophrenia.Activities of Daily Living* Aged Behavior / drug effects* Cholinesterase Inhibitors / therapeutic use* Chronic Disease Cognition / drug effects* Dementia / complications Dementia / drug therapy* Female Humans Male Phenylcarbamates / therapeutic use* Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Rivastigmine Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Schizophrenic Psychology Sex Factors Treatment OutcomeQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Sensory gating is an adaptive mechanism of the brain to prevent overstimulation. Patients suffering from clinical disorders such as Alzheimer's disease or schizophrenia exhibit a deficit in gating, which indicates not only an impairment in basic information processing that might contribute to the cognitive problems seen in these patients. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5-Is) have been shown to improve cognition in rodents in various behavioural tasks and might consequently be an interesting target for cognition enhancement. However, the effects of PDE5-Is on sensory gating are not known yet.\n",
      "This work aims to study the effects of PDE5 inhibition on auditory sensory gating in rats and humans.\n",
      "In the rat study, vehicle or 0.3-3 mg/kg of the PDE5-I vardenafil was given orally 30 min before testing and electrode locations were the vertex, hippocampus and the striatum. The human subjects received placebo, 10-20 mg vardenafil 85 min before testing and sensory gating was measured at the cortex (Fz, Fcz and Cz) electrodes.\n",
      "Significant gating was only found for the N1 component in rats while all three peaks P1, N1 and P2 showed gating in humans, i.e. the response to the second sound click was decreased as compared with the first for these deflections. Administration of vardenafil did neither have an effect on sensory gating in rats nor in humans.\n",

      "Epigenetic dysfunction is implicated in many neurological and psychiatric diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Consequently, histone deacetylases (HDACs) are being aggressively pursued as therapeutic targets. However, a fundamental knowledge gap exists regarding the expression and distribution of HDACs in healthy individuals for comparison to disease states. Here, we report the first-in-human evaluation of neuroepigenetic regulation in vivo. Using positron emission tomography with [(11)C]Martinostat, an imaging probe selective for class I HDACs (isoforms 1, 2, and 3), we found that HDAC expression is higher in cortical gray matter than in white matter, with conserved regional distribution patterns within and between healthy individuals. Among gray matter regions, HDAC expression was lowest in the hippocampus and amygdala. Through biochemical profiling of postmortem human brain tissue, we confirmed that [(11)C]Martinostat selectively binds HDAC isoforms 1, 2, and 3, the HDAC subtypes most implicated in regulating neuroplasticity and cognitive function. In human stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells, pharmacologic-level doses of Martinostat induced changes in genes closely associated with synaptic plasticity, including BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) and SYP (synaptophysin), as well as genes implicated in neurodegeneration, including GRN (progranulin), at the transcript level, in concert with increased acetylation at both histone H3 lysine 9 and histone H4 lysine 12. This study quantifies HDAC expression in the living human brain and provides the foundation for gaining unprecedented in vivo epigenetic information in health and disease.Adamantane / analogs & derivatives* Adamantane / metabolism Adult Brain / metabolism Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor / metabolism Female Healthy Volunteers Histone Deacetylases / metabolism* Humans Hydroxamic Acids / chemistry Hydroxamic Acids / metabolism* Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins / metabolism Male Positron-Emission Tomography / methods* Progranulins Protein Isoforms / metabolism* Synaptophysin / metabolism Vorinostat Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Comorbid schizophrenia and dementia is a common clinical phenomenon; however, management of the coexisting illnesses remains incomplete. Donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor, may be beneficial for the management of symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, a disease in which cholinergic pathways in the cerebral cortex and basal forebrain are well known to be compromised. Furthermore, impaired cognition in elderly schizophrenic patients has been observed to be more than two thirds; however, there are no published controlled studies reporting the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in the management of schizophrenia in patients with associated dementia. In this study, six patients with chronic schizophrenia and comorbid dementia were administered donepezil, 5 mg, in single-blind fashion as augmentation to their standard antipsychotic medication for a 4-week period. Patients were evaluated with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE); Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, Cognitive subscale; Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS); and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scales. A significant improvement was noted in MMSE scores (P < 0.01) and for CGI scores (P < 0.01). In addition, three patients demonstrated improvement on the PANSS. Donepezil appears to be an effective treatment for the management of symptoms of dementia accompanying patients with comorbid schizophrenia and dementia. Since cholinergic dysfunction may be present in some patients with schizophrenia, the authors' findings further demonstrate the possibility that this disorder may be managed with cholinergic medications as augmenting agents, at least in this specific subpopulation of patients with comorbid dementia. To confirm the findings of this preliminary trial, further investigation is mandated with a larger sample of subjects in the context of a double-blind medication trial.Aged Cholinesterase Inhibitors / adverse effects Cholinesterase Inhibitors / therapeutic use* Dementia / complications Dementia / drug therapy* Donepezil Drug Therapy, Combination Female Humans Indans / adverse effects Indans / therapeutic use* Male Middle Aged Nootropic Agents / adverse effects Nootropic Agents / therapeutic use* Piperidines / adverse effects Piperidines / therapeutic use* Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Schizophrenic Psychology* Single-Blind Method Treatment OutcomeQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Dysfunction in the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) system has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, and it has been postulated that treatments that increase nAChR activity may improve symptoms of the disorder. We investigated the effects of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and allosteric nAChR modulator, galantamine, on cognitive performance and clinical symptoms when added to a stable antipsychotic medication regimen in nonsmoking outpatients with schizophrenia in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design. Participants were randomized to receive either galantamine (n=10) up to 32 mg/day or identical placebo (n=10) for 8 weeks and completed a cognitive battery at baseline and week 8 and clinical scales at baseline, week 4 and week 8. The primary outcome measure was attentional performance as measured by the d' measure in the Continuous Performance Test - Identical Pairs (CPT-IP) Version. Contrary to our hypothesis, galantamine treatment was associated with inferior performance on the CPT-IP, on the three-card Stroop task, and on the Letter-Number Span task without reordering. Galantamine had no effect on clinical symptoms. In summary, galantamine treatment, at a dose of 32 mg/day, was well tolerated but was not effective as an adjunctive treatment for cognitive deficits in stable nonsmokers with schizophrenia.Ambulatory Care Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use* Attention / drug effects Cholinesterase Inhibitors / pharmacology Cholinesterase Inhibitors / therapeutic use* Cognition Disorders / diagnosis Cognition Disorders / drug therapy* Cognition Disorders / psychology Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Drug Therapy, Combination Female Galantamine / pharmacology Galantamine / therapeutic use* Humans Inhibition, Psychological Male Memory / drug effects Middle Aged Neuropsychological Tests / statistics & numerical data* Placebos Regression Analysis Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Schizophrenia / epidemiology Schizophrenic Psychology Smoking / epidemiology* Treatment OutcomeQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "The mismatch negativity (MMN) auditory event-related potential (ERP) has been extensively studied as a potential biomarker for abnormal auditory processing in schizophrenia (SZ), a population which exhibits abnormally high smoking rates. The relationship between nicotinic activation and cognition in SZ may be related to underlying nicotinic and NMDA receptor dysfunction within the disease. However, transient cognitive improvements via smoking in patients may also result from monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibition, achieved through tobacco smoke. In 24 healthy non-smoking males, we investigated the separate and combined effects of nicotine and MAO-A inhibition via moclobemide (75mg) on the optimal-5 variation of the MMN paradigm. No significant drug effects were observed in our total sample, however, stratification of individuals into low (N=12) and high (N=12) baseline MMN amplitude groups revealed increases in duration MMN amplitude relative to placebo by nicotine, as well as moclobemide, but not after the combination of the two. Because previous research has shown there was no effect of monoamine modulation on MMN, this study shows an unexpected effect of moclobemide on duration MMN.Adult Cross-Over Studies Double-Blind Method Drug Combinations Evoked Potentials / drug effects* Evoked Potentials / physiology Humans Male Moclobemide / administration & dosage* Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors / administration & dosage* Monoamine Oxidase* / metabolism Nicotine / administration & dosage* Photic Stimulation / methodsQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "The individualized occupational therapy (IOT) program is a psychosocial program that we developed to facilitate proactive participation in treatment and improve cognitive functioning and other outcomes for inpatients with acute schizophrenia. The program consists of motivational interviewing, self-monitoring, individualized visits, handicraft activities, individualized psychoeducation, and discharge planning. This multicenter, open-labeled, blinded-endpoint, randomized controlled trial evaluated the impact of adding IOT to a group OT (GOT) program as usual for outcomes in recently hospitalized patients with schizophrenia in Japanese psychiatric hospitals setting compared with GOT alone. Patients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to the GOT+IOT group or the GOT alone group. Among 136 randomized patients, 129 were included in the intent-to-treat population: 66 in the GOT+IOT and 63 in the GOT alone groups. Outcomes were administered at baseline and discharge or 3 months following hospitalization including the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia Japanese version (BACS-J), the Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale Japanese version, the Social Functioning Scale Japanese version, the Global Assessment of Functioning scale, the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory Japanese version (IMI-J), the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8 (MMAS-8), the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and the Japanese version of Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8J). Results of linear mixed effects models indicated that the IOT+GOT showed significant improvements in verbal memory (p <0.01), working memory (p = 0.02), verbal fluency (p < 0.01), attention (p < 0.01), and composite score (p < 0.01) on the BACS-J; interest/enjoyment (p < 0.01), value/usefulness (p < 0.01), perceived choice (p < 0.01), and IMI-J total (p < 0.01) on the IMI-J; MMAS-8 score (p < 0.01) compared with the GOT alone. Patients in the GOT+IOT demonstrated significant improvements on the CSQ-8J compared with the GOT alone (p < 0.01). The present findings provide support for the feasibility in implementing an IOT program and its effectiveness for improving cognitive impairment and other outcomes in patients with schizophrenia.Adult Cognition Humans Male Motivational Interviewing Neuropsychological Tests Occupational Therapy / methods* Patient Discharge Patient Education as Topic Schizophrenia / therapy*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Schizophrenia is associated with poor cognitive function and elevated cardiometabolic disease risk. These health concerns may exacerbate neurocognitive dysfunction associated with hippocampal abnormalities, particularly hippocampal volume reductions. Regular exercise is thought to improve symptom severity, reduce depression, and improve cognition in schizophrenia, and may trigger exercise-mediated hippocampal growth. The potential for the benefits of exercise for treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients has not been clearly assessed. This study aims to assess the effect of exercise on hippocampal plasticity and clinical outcomes in chronic schizophrenia.\n",
      "Seventeen DSM-IV criteria schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder patients completed a customized moderate intensity 12-week aerobic or weight-bearing exercise program. Adherence rates were 83% ± 9.4%) with 70% of participants completing the entire exercise program. Concomitant neuroimaging, clinical and cognitive assessments were obtained at baseline and 12-weeks.\n",

      "Even today, patients with schizophrenia often have an unfavorable outcome. Negative symptoms and cognitive deficits are common features in many patients and prevent recovery. In recent years, aerobic endurance training has emerged as a therapeutic approach with positive effects on several domains of patients' health. However, appropriately sized, multicenter randomized controlled trials that would allow better generalization of results are lacking. The exercise study presented here is a multicenter, rater-blind, two-armed, parallel-group randomized clinical trial in patients with clinically stable schizophrenia being conducted at five German tertiary hospitals. The intervention group performs aerobic endurance training on bicycle ergometers three times per week for 40-50 min/session (depending on the intervention week) for a total of 26 weeks, and the control group performs balance and tone training for the same amount of time. Participants are subsequently followed up for 26 weeks. The primary endpoint is all-cause discontinuation; secondary endpoints include psychopathology, cognition, daily functioning, cardiovascular risk factors, and explorative biological measures regarding the underlying mechanisms of exercise. A total of 180 patients will be randomized. With currently 162 randomized participants, our study is the largest trial to date to investigate endurance training in patients with schizophrenia. We hypothesize that aerobic endurance training has beneficial effects on patients' mental and physical health, leading to lower treatment discontinuation rates and improving disease outcomes. The study results will provide a basis for recommending exercise interventions as an add-on therapy in patients with schizophrenia.The study is registered in the International Clinical Trials Database (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier [NCT number]: NCT03466112) and in the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS-ID: DRKS00009804).Adolescent Adult Aged Data Interpretation, Statistical Endurance Training* Female Humans Male Middle Aged Outcome Assessment, Health Care Psychiatric Rehabilitation* Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic* / methods Research Design* Schizophrenia / rehabilitation* Single-Blind Method Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Social cognition (SC), the mental operations underlying social functioning, are impaired in schizophrenia. Their direct link to functional outcome and illness status have made them an important therapeutic target. However, no effective treatment for these deficits is currently applied as a standard of care. To address this need, we have developed SocialVille-an online, plasticity-based training program that targets SC deficits in schizophrenia. Here we report the outcomes of a double-blind, controlled, randomized, multi-site clinical trial of SocialVille. Outpatients with schizophrenia were randomized to complete 40 sessions of either SocialVille (N = 55 completers) or active control (computer games; N = 53 completers) from home. The a priori co-primary outcome measures were a social cognitive composite and a functional capacity outcome (UCSD Performance-based Skills Assessment [UPSA-2]). Secondary outcomes included a virtual functional capacity measure (VRFCAT), social functioning, quality of life, and motivation. Linear mixed models revealed a group × time interaction favoring the treatment group for the social cognitive composite (b = 2.81; P < .001) but not for the UPSA-2 measure. Analysis of secondary outcome measures showed significant group × time effects favoring the treatment group on SC and social functioning, on the virtual functional capacity measure and a motivation subscale, although these latter findings were nonsignificant with FDR correction. These results provide support for the efficacy of a remote, plasticity-based social cognitive training program in improving SC and social functioning in schizophrenia. Such treatments may serve as a cost-effective adjunct to existing psychosocial treatments.

      "The current study aimed to evaluate the effects of exercise on negative and cognitive symptoms and simultaneous evaluation of brain and hippocampus volume in patients with schizophrenia. Forty patients with schizophrenia were randomly divided into two groups. The intervention group, in addition to pharmacological treatment, underwent a multi-session exercise program for 8 weeks. At the beginning and end of the study, patients were assessed for cognitive status and negative symptoms using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), respectively. Total brain volume and hippocampus volume were also measured using magnetic resonance imaging. Overall, mean MMSE score significantly improved over time, but this improvement was greater in the intervention group (29%) compared to the control group (11%). The same was true for the PANSS negative score (21.5% vs. 53.5%). Absolute hippocampus volume during these 8 weeks, in exercise and control groups, increased from 6.24 to 7.11 and 6.44 to 6.59, respectively.

      "Cognitive impairment is a core symptom in schizophrenia that has a significant impact on psychosocial function, but shows a weak response to pharmacological treatment. Consequently, a variety of cognitive remediation strategies have been evaluated to improve cognitive function in schizophrenia. The efficacy of computer-based cognitive remediation as a stand-alone intervention on general measures of neuropsychological function remains unclear. We tested the effectiveness of biweekly training using computerized cognitive remediation programs on neuropsychological and event-related potential outcome measures. Schizophrenia patients were randomly assigned to cognitive remediation training (N=17), active control (TV-watching; N=17), or treatment-as-usual (N=10) groups for ten weeks and run in parallel. Cognitive and ERP measures revealed no differential improvement over time in the cognitive remediation group. Practice effects might explain change over time on several cognitive measures for all groups, consistent with studies indicating task-specific improvement. Computer-assisted cognitive remediation alone may not be sufficient for robust or generalized effects on cognitive and electrophysiological measures in schizophrenia patients.Acoustic Stimulation Adult Analysis of Variance Cognition Disorders / etiology* Cognition Disorders / rehabilitation* Electroencephalography Event-Related Potentials, P300 / physiology Female Humans Male Middle Aged Negotiating / methods* Neuropsychological Tests Outcome Assessment, Health Care Pilot Projects Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Schizophrenia / complications* Schizophrenia / rehabilitation Schizophrenic Psychology* Single-Blind Method Therapy, Computer-Assisted*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Whereas the efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation in schizophrenia is widely known, studies examining mechanisms for functional improvement are still scarce. The aim of the study was to examine the mediational mechanisms through which cognitive rehabilitation improves functioning in schizophrenia. One hundred and eleven schizophrenia patients were randomly assigned to either a 4-month cognitive rehabilitation group or an active control group. Patients underwent a neurocognitive battery (including processing speed, verbal memory, working memory and executive functioning) and social cognition assessment (emotion perception, theory of mind and social perception). Functioning was assessed by the combined use of a performance-based instrument, the UCSD Performance-based Skills Assessment (UPSA) and an observer-rated instrument, the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF). The trial was registered in clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02796417). Multiple mediational analyses revealed that the effect of cognitive rehabilitation on functional improvement was partially mediated by changes in processing speed and verbal memory, but not by the domains of social cognition and negative symptoms. More specifically, verbal memory partially mediated the treatment's effect on performance-based functioning (UPSA), whereas processing speed acted as a partial mediator for observer-rated functioning (GAF). The effect of rehabilitation on functioning did not take place through all the domains that showed significant improvement. Verbal memory and processing speed emerged as the most crucial factors. However, these complex interactions need further research.Activities of Daily Living Adult Cognitive Dysfunction / etiology Cognitive Dysfunction / physiopathology* Cognitive Dysfunction / rehabilitation* Cognitive Remediation / methods* Emotional Intelligence / physiology Executive Function / physiology* Female Humans Male Memory, Short-Term / physiology Outcome Assessment, Health Care* Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / rehabilitation* Social Perception* Theory of Mind / physiology Verbal Learning / physiologyQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia is a core feature of the disorder. Computerized cognitive training has shown promise in pilot studies. A 26-week randomized blinded placebo-controlled trial was conducted to investigate the effect of a novel computerized cognitive training program on cognitive and functional capacity outcomes.\n",
      "The study followed MATRICS guidelines for the evaluation of interventions designed to improve cognitive function in schizophrenia. Participants (N = 150) were randomized to experimental (computerized cognitive training in a game-like format) or active control (computer games) groups. Training was conducted in-clinic, with an intended training schedule of 5 days per week, 1 h per day, for 26 weeks. Co-primary outcome measures were the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) composite score and the UCSD Performance-Based Skills Assessment (UPSA-2) total score, secondary outcome measures included the Cognitive Assessment Interview (CAI) and the Short-Form-12 Mental Composite Score (SF-12 MCS). Target engagement was assessed with task-learning based assessment.\n",

      "Cognitive impairment is common in schizophrenia, and is associated with poor psychosocial functioning. Previous studies had inconsistently shown improvement in cognitive functions with cognitive remediation therapy. This study examined whether cognitive remediation is effective in improving both cognitive and social functions in schizophrenia in outpatient settings that provide learning-based psychiatric rehabilitation. This study is the first randomized controlled trial of cognitive remediation in Japan.\n",
      "Study participants were individuals with schizophrenia from 6 outpatient psychiatric medical facilities who were randomly assigned either a cognitive remediation program or treatment as usual. The cognitive remediation intervention includes Cognitive training using computer software (CogPack; Japanese version) administered twice a week and a weekly group over 12 weeks and was based on the Thinking Skills for Work program. Most study participants were attending day treatment services where social skills training, psychoeducation for knowledge about schizophrenia, group activities such as recreation and sport, and other psychosocial treatment were offered. Cognitive and social functioning were assessed using the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) and Life Assessment Scale for Mentally Ill (LASMI) at pre- and postintervention.\n",
      "Of the 60 people with schizophrenia enrolled, 29 were allocated to the cognitive remediation group and 31 were allocated to the treatment as usual group. Processing speed, executive function, and the composite score of the BACS showed significantly greater improvement for the cognitive remediation group than the treatment as usual group. In addition, there was significant improvement in interpersonal relationships and work skills on the LASMI for the cognitive remediation group compared with the treatment as usual group. Changes from pretreatment to posttreatment in verbal fluency and interpersonal relationships were significantly correlated, as well as changes in attention and work skills.\n",
      "The present findings showed that providing cognitive remediation on addition to psychiatric rehabilitation contributed to greater improvement in both cognitive and social functioning than psychiatric rehabilitation alone.

      "Cognitive deficits, which are core manifestations in schizophrenia and exhibit a limited response to antipsychotic treatment, contribute to poor treatment outcomes and functional disability. Evidence on the effect of aerobic walking (AW) and exercise intensity on cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia is lacking. In total, 79 patients with schizophrenia were recruited for a 12-week randomized control trial and allocated to the treatment-as-usual (TAU, n = 38) and treatment-as-usual plus AW (TAW, n = 39) groups. The TAW participants joined a supervised 12-week AW program consisting of 30-min sessions five times per week while wearing a Fitbit Charge 2 device. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia. After randomization, 67 (34 TAU and 33 TAW) participants joined the 12-week trial and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Multivariate general linear model repeated measures analysis revealed no significant time × group interaction effect on cognitive function changes between the TAU and TAW groups and a marginally significant group effect on verbal fluency (p = 0.09). The interaction effect of time and treatment group on verbal fluency (p = 0.05) was marginally significant between the high and low AW intensity groups, whereas a significant group effect on attention and processing speed (p = 0.04) was observed.

      "Schizophrenia is characterized by dysfunction in basic auditory processing, as well as higher-order operations of verbal learning and executive functions. We investigated whether targeted cognitive training of auditory processing improves neural responses to speech stimuli, and how these changes relate to higher-order cognitive functions. Patients with schizophrenia performed an auditory syllable identification task during magnetoencephalography before and after 50 hours of either targeted cognitive training or a computer games control. Healthy comparison subjects were assessed at baseline and after a 10 week no-contact interval. Prior to training, patients (N = 34) showed reduced M100 response in primary auditory cortex relative to healthy participants (N = 13). At reassessment, only the targeted cognitive training patient group (N = 18) exhibited increased M100 responses. Additionally, this group showed increased induced high gamma band activity within left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex immediately after stimulus presentation, and later in bilateral temporal cortices. Training-related changes in neural activity correlated with changes in executive function scores but not verbal learning and memory. These data suggest that computerized cognitive training that targets auditory and verbal learning operations enhances both sensory responses in auditory cortex as well as engagement of prefrontal regions, as indexed during an auditory processing task with low demands on working memory. This neural circuit enhancement is in turn associated with better executive function but not verbal memory.Adult Auditory Cortex / physiology Auditory Cortex / physiopathology* Case-Control Studies Cognition Disorders / physiopathology Cognition Disorders / rehabilitation* Female Humans Magnetoencephalography Male Memory, Short-Term Middle Aged Neuronal Plasticity / physiology* Prefrontal Cortex / physiology Prefrontal Cortex / physiopathology* Psychiatric Rehabilitation / methods* Schizophrenia / physiopathology Schizophrenia / rehabilitation* Schizophrenic Psychology Therapy, Computer-Assisted Verbal LearningQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Cognitive impairment is the most important feature of schizophrenia leading to severe functional disability. To identify pathways that improve pathophysiological neurocognition in schizophrenia is a current challenge for the development of goal-directed clinical interventions. In the present study, we investigated the effects of raloxifene (a selective estrogen modulator) and isradipine (a voltage-gated L-type calcium channel blocker) on cognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia.\n",
      "We designed a double-blind, randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled trial. We randomized 60 patients with schizophrenia into 3 groups including isradipine 5 mg, raloxifine 60 mg, and placebo for 6 consequent weeks, all in the same shape capsules, 2 times a day, along with treatment as usual. The initial and final results of blood tests, electrocardiograms, and cognitive tests in specific domains, such as attention, processing speed, executive function, and verbal memory were evaluated.\n",
      "Our findings revealed a remarkable association between adjunctive raloxifene treatment and the alleviation of verbal memory deficits. Isradipine treatment significantly improved the verbal memory and attention dysfunction in some variables of the Stroop test, compared with the placebo.

      "Cognitive deficits and negative symptoms in schizophrenia are associated with poor functional outcomes and limited in terms of treatment. The Schizophrenia Treatment With Electric Transcranial Stimulation (STARTS) trial has shown efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for improving negative symptoms. In this secondary analysis, we investigate its effects on cognitive performance. In STARTS, a double-blinded, sham-controlled, randomized clinical trial, patients were treated with twice-daily, 20-min, 2-mA fronto-temporal tDCS over 5 days or sham-tDCS. In 90 patients, we evaluated the cognitive performance up to 12 weeks post-treatment. We found that active-tDCS showed no beneficial effects over sham-tDCS in any of the tests. Based on a 5-factor cognitive model, improvements of executive functions and delayed memory were observed in favor of sham-tDCS. Overall, the applied active-tDCS protocol, primarily designed to improve negative symptoms, did not promote cognitive improvement. We discuss possible protocol modification potentially required to increase tDCS effects on cognition.

      "Auditory-based targeted cognitive training (TCT) is an effective and well-validated intervention for the treatment of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia patients. Improvements in higher-order cognition, reductions in symptom severity, and increases in psychosocial functioning secondary to TCT are thought to be driven by \"bottom-up\" enhancement of early auditory information processing (EAIP). Despite strong evidence of efficacy at the group level, there is significant variability in response to TCT, with few well-delineated biomarkers for predicting individual benefit. EEG biomarkers of EAIP are indicators of early-treatment sensitivity that predict full-course TCT outcome; however, further characterization is necessary for biomarker-guided clinical trials. The current study examined baseline and early-treatment sensitivity (i.e., change from baseline after 1 h) in theta band oscillatory activity to deviant stimuli as moderators of full course (30 h) TCT response in treatment-refractory schizophrenia patients randomly assigned to receive either treatment-as-usual (TAU; n = 22) or TAU augmented with TCT (n = 30). Theta evoked power and phase locking at baseline predicted patient improvements in global cognitive function after 30 h of TCT. Decrease in theta activity to deviant stimuli after 1 h of TCT predicted improvements in verbal learning after 30 h. Exploratory analyses using EEG composite scores had high levels of sensitivity and specificity for identifying patients most likely to benefit from TCT. The integrity of baseline neurophysiologic activity associated with EAIP, as well as the sensitivity of the underlying circuity to change, likely reflects an intermediate therapeutic process underlying the effectiveness of TCT that can be used to predict patient response to treatment.Adult Auditory Perception / physiology* Biomarkers Cerebral Cortex / physiopathology* Cognitive Dysfunction* / etiology Cognitive Dysfunction* / physiopathology Cognitive Dysfunction* / rehabilitation Cognitive Remediation* Electroencephalography Phase Synchronization / physiology* Evoked Potentials / physiology* Evoked Potentials, Auditory / physiology Female Humans Male Middle Aged Outcome Assessment, Health Care* Schizophrenia* / complications Schizophrenia* / physiopathology Schizophrenia* / rehabilitation Theta Rhythm / physiology*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Cognitive impairments are one of the main contributors to disability and poor long-term outcome in schizophrenia. Proof-of-concept trials indicate that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has the potential to improve cognitive functioning. We analyzed the effects of 10-Hz rTMS to the left DLPFC on cognitive deficits in schizophrenia in a large-scale and multicenter, sham-controlled study. A total of 156 schizophrenia patients with predominant negative symptoms were randomly assigned to a 3-week intervention (10-Hz rTMS, 15 sessions, 1000 stimuli per session) with either active or sham rTMS. The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Trail Making Test A and B, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Digit Span Test, and the Regensburg Word Fluency Test were administered before intervention and at day 21, 45, and 105 follow-up. From the test results, a neuropsychological composite score was computed. Both groups showed no differences in any of the outcome variables before and after intervention. Both groups improved markedly over time, but effect sizes indicate a numeric, but nonsignificant superiority of active rTMS in certain cognitive tests. Active 10-Hz rTMS applied to the left DLPFC for 3 weeks was not superior to sham rTMS in the improvement of various cognitive domains in schizophrenia patients with predominant negative symptoms. This is in contrast to previous preliminary proof-of-concept trials, but highlights the need for more multicenter randomized controlled trials in the field of noninvasive brain stimulation.Adult Cognitive Dysfunction / etiology Cognitive Dysfunction / therapy* Female Humans Male Middle Aged Outcome Assessment, Health Care* Placebos Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / therapy* Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation / methods* Treatment OutcomeQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "LPFC dysfunction is a well-established neural impairment in schizophrenia and is associated with worse symptoms. However, how LPFC activation influences symptoms is unclear. Previous findings in healthy individuals demonstrate that lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) activation during cognitive control of emotional information predicts mood and behavior in response to interpersonal conflict, thus impairments in these processes may contribute to symptom exacerbation in schizophrenia. We investigated whether schizophrenia participants show LPFC deficits during cognitive control of emotional information, and whether these LPFC deficits prospectively predict changes in mood and symptoms following real-world interpersonal conflict. During fMRI, 23 individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 24 healthy controls completed the Multi-Source Interference Task superimposed on neutral and negative pictures. Afterwards, schizophrenia participants completed a 21-day online daily-diary in which they rated the extent to which they experienced mood and schizophrenia-spectrum symptoms, as well as the occurrence and response to interpersonal conflict. Schizophrenia participants had lower dorsal LPFC activity (BA9) during cognitive control of task-irrelevant negative emotional information. Within schizophrenia participants, DLPFC activity during cognitive control of emotional information predicted changes in positive and negative mood on days following highly distressing interpersonal conflicts. Results have implications for understanding the specific role of LPFC in response to social stress in schizophrenia, and suggest that treatments targeting LPFC-mediated cognitive control of emotion could promote adaptive response to social stress in schizophrenia.Adult Emotions* / physiology Female Humans Interpersonal Relations* Magnetic Resonance Imaging / methods Male Middle Aged Photic Stimulation / methods Predictive Value of Tests Prefrontal Cortex / metabolism* Reaction Time / physiology Schizophrenia / diagnosis Schizophrenia / metabolism* Schizophrenic Psychology* Stress, Psychological / diagnosis Stress, Psychological / metabolism* Stress, Psychological / psychology Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Impairments in mismatch negativity (MMN) generation have been consistently reported in patients with schizophrenia. However, underlying oscillatory activity of MMN deficits in schizophrenia and the relationship with cognitive impairments have not been investigated in detail. Time-frequency power and phase analyses can provide more detailed measures of brain dynamics of MMN deficits in schizophrenia.\n",
      "21 patients with schizophrenia and 21 healthy controls were tested with a roving frequency paradigm to generate MMN. Time-frequency domain power and phase-locking (PL) analysis was performed on all trials using short-time Fourier transforms with Hanning window tapering. A comprehensive battery (CANTAB) was used to assess neurocognitive functioning.\n",
      "Mean MMN amplitude was significantly lower in patients with schizophrenia (95% CI 0.18 - 0.77). Patients showed significantly lower EEG power (95% CI -1.02 - -0.014) in the ~4-7 Hz frequency range (theta band) between 170 and 210 ms. Patients with schizophrenia showed cognitive impairment in multiple domains of CANTAB. However, MMN impairments in amplitude and power were not correlated with clinical measures, medication dose, social functioning or neurocognitive performance.\n",
      "The findings from this study suggested that while MMN may be a useful marker to probe NMDA receptor mediated mechanisms and associated impairments in gain control and perceptual changes, it may not be a useful marker in association with clinical or cognitive changes. Trial-by-trial EEG power analysis can be used as a measure of brain dynamics underlying MMN deficits which also can have implications for the use of MMN as a biomarker for drug discovery.Adolescent Adult Brain / physiopathology* Cognition / physiology* Electroencephalography Female Humans Male Matched-Pair Analysis Middle Aged Negativism* Neuropsychological Tests Schizophrenia / physiopathology* Schizophrenic Psychology* Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Cognitive improvement after antipsychotic agents in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) appears to involve redox regulation through neurotrophins such as brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF). This study examined whether cognitive improvement was associated with the increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and whether higher levels of BDNF could have a permissive role in allowing SOD to improve cognition.\n",
      "We examined this hypothesis in 183 drug-naïve first-episode SCZ patients taking risperidone monotherapy for 12 weeks. We measured total copper-zinc SOD (CuZn-SOD), manganese SOD (Mn-SOD), and SOD activities and BDNF levels in these patients and compared their levels with 152 healthy controls. We assessed cognitive functioning and clinical symptoms at baseline and 12-week follow-up.\n",
      "After treatment with risperidone, CuZn-SOD activity was significantly increased, and BDNF levels were slightly increased. Increased CuZn-SOD activity was associated with the cognitive effectiveness of risperidone monotherapy. The BDNF levels and SOD activities were correlated at baseline but not after 12-week treatment. Furthermore, baseline CuZn-SOD activity positively correlated with improvement on the delayed memory subscale of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status only in the high BDNF subgroup.\n",
      "Our longitudinal study suggests that risperidone can enhance SOD activity and that, in combination with higher baseline BDNF levels acting in a permissive role, can improve cognitive impairments in SCZ. Greater baseline CuZn-SOD activity also may have predictive value for cognitive improvement of delayed memory in SCZ patients receiving risperidone treatment.Adolescent Adult Antioxidants / therapeutic use Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use* Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor / metabolism* Cognition / drug effects Cognitive Dysfunction / drug therapy* Female Humans Longitudinal Studies Male Middle Aged Risperidone / therapeutic use* Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Superoxide Dismutase / metabolism* Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "The patients in the CRT group presented with improvements in both cognition and quality of life. However, no significant changes were detected in the serum levels of BDNF. Interestingly, we found a significant positive interaction effect between the serum BDNF levels and the different BDNF genotypes. The Val/Val group showed significantly higher serum levels after the CRT treatment. However, the interaction among the serum BDNF levels, the BDNF genotypes and the treatment condition was not statistically significant.\n",
      "The replication of the previous finding of increased serum BDNF levels after cognitive remediation in clinically stable individuals with schizophrenia was not achieved. However, our data indicated that genetic variability may be mediating serum BDNF activity in the context of CRT.Adult Biomarkers / blood Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor / blood* Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor / genetics Cognitive Dysfunction / etiology Cognitive Dysfunction / therapy* Cognitive Remediation / methods* Female Humans Male Middle Aged Outcome Assessment, Health Care* Quality of Life Schizophrenia / blood* Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / therapy*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Schizophrenia patients suffer from severe cognitive deficits, such as impaired reality monitoring. Reality monitoring is the ability to distinguish the source of internal experiences from outside reality. During reality monitoring tasks, schizophrenia patients make errors identifying \"I made it up\" items, and even during accurate performance, they show abnormally low activation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a region that supports self-referential cognition. We administered 80 hr of computerized training of cognitive processes to schizophrenia patients and found improvement in reality monitoring that correlated with increased mPFC activity. In contrast, patients in a computer games control condition did not show any behavioral or neural improvements. Notably, recovery in mPFC activity after training was associated with improved social functioning 6 months later. These findings demonstrate that a serious behavioral deficit in schizophrenia, and its underlying neural dysfunction, can be improved by well-designed computerized cognitive training, resulting in better quality of life.Adult Brain / blood supply Brain / physiopathology Brain Mapping Cognition Disorders / etiology* Cognition Disorders / rehabilitation* Cognitive Behavioral Therapy / methods* Female Humans Image Processing, Computer-Assisted Male Middle Aged Neuropsychological Tests Oxygen / blood Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Schizophrenia / complications* Schizophrenia / pathology* Schizophrenic Psychology* Signal Detection, Psychological / physiology Therapy, Computer-AssistedQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Poor treatment engagement is an enduring problem in the care of patients with schizophrenia. Evidence suggests that targeted cognitive training (TCT) improves cognition and functional outcomes, but this time-consuming intervention might reduce patients' engagement in other treatment activities when implemented in real-world settings. This is especially true of residential care programs which encourage patients to engage in group therapies, self-care, and a wide variety of structured social, work, and other rehabilitation activities. This study aimed to determine whether TCT negatively impacts engagement in other psychosocial treatments. Patients with schizophrenia were recruited from a community-based residential care program and randomized to one of two intervention arms: treatment as usual (TAU; n = 22) or TAU augmented with TCT (n = 24). Psychosocial treatment engagement was tracked over 20 weeks. Treatment groups did not significantly differ on baseline variables or psychosocial treatment engagement in the 5 weeks prior to randomization. TCT had a positive effect on engagement (β = 0.112, p = 0.003), but there was no treatment-by-time interaction (β = -0.029, p = 0.672). Participants in TCT engaged in an average of 1.34 additional group therapies, 0.58 additional activities of daily living, and 0.84 additional rehabilitation activities per week in comparison to TAU participants. Baseline cognition was also a significant predictor of psychosocial treatment engagement. Overall, results suggest that TCT can be implemented in real-world settings without negatively impacting engagement in other psychosocial treatments. Additional studies are needed to determine what role nonspecific factors play in the positive impact of TCT.Activities of Daily Living Adult Cognitive Dysfunction / etiology Cognitive Dysfunction / rehabilitation* Cognitive Remediation / methods* Female Humans Male Middle Aged Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care* Patient Acceptance of Health Care* Patient Participation Psychotherapy, Group / methods* Residential Treatment Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / rehabilitation* Therapy, Computer-Assisted / methods* Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Although controversial, evidence from various experimental sources suggests a dysfunction/overactivity of the hemisphere dominant for speech - usually the left - in schizophrenia and of the other one in depression. Based on these lateralization hypotheses and on the dependency of regional cerebral blood flow on regional neuronal activity, the concept of pharmacopsychotherapy was proposed. The present double-blind pilot study tried to test this concept by cognitive training procedures tentatively relevant to the mechanisms of information processing of the left (analytical) and right (holistic) hemisphere, respectively. It was hypothesized that the outcome of patients putatively trained in mechanisms of the right hemisphere might be superior to that of those trained left in depression and the converse in schizophrenia. This hypothesis could not be verified. Apparent differences in the outcome of depressives were attributable to differences of independent variables (age, seriousness of illness).Adolescent Adult Aged Cognition Disorders / therapy* Combined Modality Therapy Depressive Disorder / psychology Depressive Disorder / therapy* Dominance, Cerebral* / drug effects Female Humans Male Middle Aged Neuropsychological Tests Pilot Projects Psychotropic Drugs / therapeutic use* Schizophrenia / therapy* Schizophrenic Psychology*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Up to 85% of patients with schizophrenia demonstrate cognitive dysfunction in at least one domain. Cognitive dysfunction plays a major role in functional outcome. It is hypothesized that addition of cognitive training to a comprehensive psychosocial programme (OPUS) enhances both cognitive and everyday functional capacity of patients more than the comprehensive psychosocial programme alone.\n",
      "The NEUROCOM trial examines the effect on cognitive functioning and everyday functional capacity of patients with schizophrenia of a 16-week manualised programme of individual cognitive training integrated in a comprehensive psychosocial programme versus the comprehensive psychosocial programme alone. The cognitive training consists of four modules focusing on attention, executive functioning, learning, and memory. Cognitive training involves computer-assisted training tasks as well as practical everyday tasks and calendar training. It takes place twice a week, and every other week the patient and trainer engage in a dialogue on the patient's cognitive difficulties, motivational goals, and progress in competence level. Cognitive training relies on errorless learning principles, scaffolding, and verbalisation in its effort to improve cognitive abilities and teach patients how to apply compensation strategies as well as structured problem solving techniques. At 16-week post-training and at ten-months follow-up, assessments are conducted to investigate immediate outcome and possible long-term effects of cognitive training. We conduct blinded assessments of cognition, everyday functional capacity and associations with the labour market, symptom severity, and self-esteem.\n",

      "This single blind, three-armed randomized controlled trial compared cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) enhanced with cognitive remediation (CBT+CR) to CBT alone and an active control condition on work and neurocognition outcomes for persons with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Seventy-five adult outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were randomized to three study conditions (N=25 per group). The CBT intervention was the Indianapolis Vocational Intervention program (IVIP), consisting of weekly group and individual sessions focused on work-related content. Participants in the CBT+CR group received IVIP and Posit Science computer-based cognitive training. The active control group consisted of weekly vocational support groups and individual vocational support sessions. All participants were placed into a noncompetitive work assignment and were followed for 26weeks. Data collection included hours worked, weekly work performance ratings, and neurocognition assessed at baseline and 6months. Neurocognition was also assessed at 12months. Data were analyzed using multilevel linear models to account for nested, repeated measures data. Results indicate that participants in the CBT+CR condition worked significantly more hours and had a more positive trajectory of improving global work performance and work quality across the study compared with the CBT alone and vocational support condition. Compared to the other conditions, CBT+CR also had a significant increase in overall neurocognition that continued to the 12month follow-up, particularly in the domains of verbal learning and social cognition. In conclusion, CBT+CR may be an effective intervention to improve work functioning and neurocognition in persons with schizophrenia.Adult Cognitive Behavioral Therapy / methods* Cognitive Dysfunction / etiology Cognitive Dysfunction / rehabilitation* Cognitive Remediation / methods* Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Male Middle Aged Outcome Assessment, Health Care* Psychotic Disorders / complications Psychotic Disorders / rehabilitation* Rehabilitation, Vocational / methods* Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / rehabilitation* Social Perception Therapy, Computer-Assisted Verbal LearningQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "There is accumulating evidence for involvement of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. A primary function supported by the PFC is working memory (WM). Findings from WM studies in schizophrenia can provide insight into the nature of clinical symptoms and cognitive deficits associated with this disorder, as well as begin to suggest areas of underlying neuropathology. To date, studies have not adequately investigated different WM domains (e.g., verbal, spatial, or object) or processing requirements (e.g., maintenance, monitoring, or manipulation), shown to be associated with distinct patterns of neural activation, in schizophrenia patients and their well relatives. Accordingly, this study evaluated the performance of schizophrenia patients, their first-degree biological relatives, and nonpsychiatric controls on a comprehensive battery of WM tasks and investigated the association among WM deficits and schizophrenia-spectrum psychopathology. The findings indicate that schizophrenia patients are consistently impaired on WM tasks, irrespective of WM domain or processing requirements. In contrast, their unaffected relatives are only impaired on WM tasks with higher central executive processing requirements. This pattern of WM performance may further implicate DLPFC dysfunction in the liability for schizophrenia and has implications for future cognitive, genetic, and neurodevelopmental research.Adult Cognition / physiology* Cognition Disorders / etiology Cognition Disorders / physiopathology Female Humans Male Memory Disorders / etiology* Memory Disorders / physiopathology Memory, Short-Term / physiology* Nuclear Family Pedigree Prefrontal Cortex / physiopathology* Reference Values Schizophrenia / complications* Schizophrenia / physiopathology Schizophrenic PsychologyQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Cognitive impairment is a central aspect of schizophrenia (SCZ) that occurs at the onset of the disease and is related to poor social function and outcome in patients with SCZ. Recent literatures have revealed repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to be one of the efficient medical interventions for cognitive impairments. However, no study has been conducted to investigate the treatment effectiveness of 20 Hz rTMS with neuronavigation system administered to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in patients with schizophrenia. In this randomized, double-blind and sham-controlled study, 56 patients were enrolled in 20 Hz rTMS (n = 28) or sham stimulation (n = 28) over left DLPFC for 8 weeks. The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) was performed to measure the cognitive function at baseline and after 8 weeks of rTMS treatment. The positive and negative syndrome scales (PANSS) was performed to assess the clinical symptoms at baseline, after 2-week treatment, 4-week treatment, 6-week treatment, and 8-week treatment. Totally, 15 subjects (seven in active group and eight in sham group) dropped out during the trial and the main findings were from completed 41 patients. At 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks, there were no significant differences in PANSS total score and subscores between the sham and treatment groups. At 8 weeks, the 20 Hz rTMS significantly increased the immediate memory score compared with the sham. Furthermore, the improvement in the immediate memory score was correlated with the decrease in the excitement factor score of the patients with SCZ. Our results suggest that 20 Hz rTMS appears to be an effective treatment for improving the cognitive performance and reducing the clinical symptoms of patients with SCZ.Cognitive Dysfunction* / therapy Double-Blind Method Humans Prefrontal Cortex Schizophrenia* / therapy Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Treatment Outcome Veterans*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Systematic cognitive training and aerobic exercise programs have emerged as promising interventions to improve cognitive deficits in first-episode schizophrenia, with successful outcomes closely linked with greater treatment engagement (e.g., higher attendance and homework completion rates). Unfortunately, treatment disengagement from these services remains a persistent issue. Intrinsic motivation, or the willingness to exert effort because a task is inherently interesting or meaningful, has emerged as a promising malleable personal factor to enhance treatment engagement. This study investigated whether early task-specific intrinsic motivation and its domains (e.g., interest, perceived competence, and value) predicted treatment engagement within the context of intensive cognitive training and aerobic exercise interventions over a 6-month period. Thirty-nine participants with first-episode schizophrenia were administered baseline measures of task-specific intrinsic motivation inventories, one for cognitive training and one for exercise, and completed a 6-month randomized clinical trial comparing a neuroplasticity-based cognitive training plus aerobic exercise program against the same cognitive training alone. Results indicated that higher baseline scores of intrinsic motivation for cognitive training, specifically early perceptions of task interest and value, were predictive of greater cognitive training and exercise group attendance. Scores for exercise-specific intrinsic motivation were generally unrelated to indices of exercise participation, with the exception that the gain over time in perceived choice for exercise was linked with greater exercise homework completion and a similar directional tendency for greater in-clinic exercise attendance. This study provides support for monitoring and enhancing motivation early during service delivery to maximize engagement and the likelihood of successful treatment outcomes.Cognitive Dysfunction* / etiology Cognitive Training Exercise Humans Motivation Schizophrenia* / complications Schizophrenia* / therapyQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Although prior research has shown that cognitive training may improve cognition for schizophrenia patients, it is currently unclear which domains of cognition should be targeted in training. One suggestion is to target low- or mid-level cognitive processes. In particular, working memory (WM) and processing speed (PS) have been named as two key areas of impairment in schizophrenia, and two domains of cognition that are linked to higher-order cognition and daily functioning. This study aimed to investigate the near-transfer (transfer of gains to related contexts), far-transfer (transfer of gains to unrelated contexts), and real-world gains associated with WM and PS training in schizophrenia.\n",
      "Eighty-three participants with schizophrenia were recruited and randomly assigned to computerized WM training, PS training, or a no-training control group. Outcome measures included WM, PS, fluid intelligence, executive functioning, social cognition, and daily functioning and symptoms.\n",
      "PS training led to significant gains in untrained PS tasks, as well as gains in far-transfer tasks that required speed of processing. WM training did not lead to gains in untrained WM tasks and showed inconsistent effects on some far-transfer tasks.\n",
      "These results suggest some benefit of domain-specific cognitive training, specifically PS training, in schizophrenia. Far-transfer of gains to other cognitive domains and to real-world functioning may not occur after targeted WM or PS training, though non-specific effects (e.g. through behavioral activation, increased motivation) may lead to improvements in some tasks. Future studies should continue to investigate the mechanisms by which cognitive training may enhance cognition and functioning in schizophrenia.Adult Canada Cognition Executive Function Female Humans Male Memory, Short-Term* Middle Aged Outcome Assessment, Health Care Schizophrenic Psychology*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Cognitive impairment and deficits in social skills have been largely documented in patients with schizophrenia and are increasingly recognized as rate-limiting factors for recovery. Evidence has been provided that cognitive training and social skills training (SST) are effective to treat cognitive and social skills impairment in schizophrenia; however, the translation of improved performance on cognitive or social skills tasks into improved functional outcome is controversial. According to recent reviews, interventions providing cognitive training in conjunction with psychosocial rehabilitation have a greater impact on functional outcome than either intervention alone suggesting that the two treatment approaches may work together in a synergistic fashion. The present pilot study was designed to test the hypothesis that an integrated rehabilitation program, including individualized cognitive and SST, is more effective than the structured leisure activities (SLA) carried out in many Italian Mental Health Departments. The primary outcome measure was subjects' personal and social functioning as assessed by the Interview for the assessment of disability. The study is based on a controlled design including randomization to treatment groups, blind assessments and stable pharmacological treatment. Subjects were recruited among patients attending three psychiatric facilities located in the Italian region Campania. Thirty patients were randomized to the experimental program \"social skills and neurocognitive individualized training\" (SSANIT), and 30 to SLA. The two programs were matched for the overall duration as well as frequency and duration of the sessions. The two groups of patients did not differ at baseline on psychopathology, neurocognitive and personal/social functioning. After 6 months of treatment, personal and social functioning was significantly better in patients assigned to SSANIT than in those assigned to usual rehabilitation activities practiced in Mental Health Departments. No advantage was observed for either program on psychopathological and cognitive outcome indices. As for other integrated programs, also for SSANIT further studies are needed to verify generalization and persistence of the observed gains, and to clarify most adequate length and doses of the therapeutic intervention as well as the relative contribution of each program component to its impact on subjects' disability.Adult Analysis of Variance Chi-Square Distribution Cognition Disorders / etiology Cognition Disorders / rehabilitation* Cognitive Behavioral Therapy / methods* Double-Blind Method Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Leisure Activities* Male Middle Aged Neuropsychological Tests Pilot Projects Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / rehabilitation* Schizophrenic Psychology* Social Behavior* Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "While there is increasing support for the efficacy of psychosocial interventions for people with SMI, the real-world effectiveness of such treatments is diminished by lack of motivation for treatment, leading to poor treatment engagement/dropout. We sought to evaluate the efficacy of motivational interviewing (MI) in improving attendance in a full course of cognitive training, examine motivation level as a potential mechanism of action, and examine variables associated with initial engagement in the training.\n",
      "One hundred fourteen participants with SMI were randomized to MI or sham control interview (CI), both of which were followed by a 4-month active phase during which participants could attend up to 50 unpaid cognitive training sessions.\n",
      "Fidelity to the MI intervention was high, and MI condition was associated with increases in perceived value of training tasks and, to a lesser extent, how enjoyable/interesting they were rated. Twenty-nine percent of the full sample did not attend any training sessions. In ITT analyses, there was no significant between-group impact of MI on treatment attendance, though one emerged when participants who did not attend any sessions were excluded. Treatment attendance was predicted by the level of motivation achieved after the MI/CI intervention. Those who attended at least one training session (regardless of randomization) were more likely to believe they had cognitive impairments, had higher IQ and had less severe general psychiatric symptoms.\n",

      "Candidate pro-cognitive drugs for schizophrenia targeting several neurochemical systems have consistently failed to demonstrate robust efficacy. It remains untested whether concurrent antipsychotic medications exert pharmacodynamic interactions that mitigate pro-cognitive action in patients. We used functional MRI (fMRI) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled within-subject crossover test of single-dose modafinil effects in 27 medicated schizophrenia patients, interrogating brainstem regions where catecholamine systems arise to innervate the cortex, to link cellular and systems-level models of cognitive control. Modafinil effects were evaluated both within this patient group and compared to a healthy subject group. Modafinil modulated activity in the locus coeruleus (LC) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) in the patient group. However, compared to the healthy comparison group, these effects were altered as a function of task demands: the control-independent drug effect on deactivation was relatively attenuated (shallower) in the LC and exaggerated (deeper) in the VTA; in contrast, again compared to the comparison group, the control-related drug effects on positive activation were attenuated in LC, VTA and the cortical cognitive control network. These altered effects in the LC and VTA were significantly and specifically associated with the degree of antagonism of alpha-2 adrenergic and dopamine-2 receptors, respectively, by concurrently prescribed antipsychotics. These sources of evidence suggest interacting effects on catecholamine neurons of chronic antipsychotic treatment, which respectively increase and decrease sustained neuronal activity in LC and VTA. This is the first direct evidence in a clinical population to suggest that antipsychotic medications alter catecholamine neuronal activity to mitigate pro-cognitive drug action on cortical circuits.Adult Antipsychotic Agents / pharmacology* Central Nervous System Stimulants / administration & dosage Central Nervous System Stimulants / pharmacology* Cognitive Dysfunction / drug therapy* Cognitive Dysfunction / etiology Cross-Over Studies Double-Blind Method Drug Interactions Drug Therapy, Combination Executive Function / drug effects* Functional Neuroimaging / methods* Humans Locus Coeruleus / drug effects* Magnetic Resonance Imaging Modafinil / administration & dosage Modafinil / pharmacology* Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-2 / drug effects* Receptors, Dopamine D2 / drug effects* Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Ventral Tegmental Area / drug effects*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Cognitive dysfunction is a pervasive and disabling aspect of schizophrenia without adequate treatments. A recognized correlate to cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia is attenuated frontal theta oscillations. Neuromodulation to normalize these frontal rhythms represents a potential novel therapeutic strategy. Here, we evaluate whether noninvasive neuromodulation of the cerebellum in patients with schizophrenia can enhance frontal theta oscillations, with the future goal of targeting the cerebellum as a possible therapy for cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. We stimulated the midline cerebellum using transcranial pulsed current stimulation (tPCS), a noninvasive transcranial direct current that can be delivered in a frequency-specific manner. A single 20-min session of theta frequency stimulation was delivered in nine patients with schizophrenia (cathode on right shoulder). Delta frequency tPCS was also delivered as a control to evaluate for frequency-specific effects. EEG signals from midfrontal electrode Cz were analyzed before and after cerebellar tPCS while patients estimated the passage of 3- and 12-s intervals. Theta oscillations were significantly larger following theta frequency cerebellar tPCS in the midfrontal region, which was not seen with delta frequency stimulation. As previously reported, patients with schizophrenia showed a baseline reduction in accuracy estimating 3- and 12-s intervals relative to control subjects, which did not significantly improve following a single-session theta or delta frequency cerebellar tPCS. These preliminary results suggest that single-session theta frequency cerebellar tPCS may modulate task-related oscillatory activity in the frontal cortex in a frequency-specific manner. These preliminary findings warrant further investigation to evaluate whether multiple sessions delivered daily may have an impact on cognitive performance and have therapeutic implications for schizophrenia.Adult Cerebellum / physiopathology* Female Frontal Lobe / physiopathology Humans Male Middle Aged Schizophrenia / physiopathology* Schizophrenia / therapy* Theta Rhythm / physiology Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

The intervention comprised in a 4-month cognitive behavioral therapy that was implemented by 33 community psychiatric nurse staff to improve the life skills and work productivity of people with schizophrenia. The instruments used to evaluate the intervention were the Indonesian version of the life skill profile (LSP) questionnaire and the work productivity and activity impairment scale (WPAI).

      "Effects of both domain-specific and broader cognitive remediation protocols have been reported for neural activity and overt performance in schizophrenia (SZ). Progress is limited by insufficient knowledge of relevant neural mechanisms. Addressing neuronal signal resolution in the auditory system as a mechanism contributing to cognitive function and dysfunction in schizophrenia, the present study compared effects of two neuroplasticity-based training protocols targeting auditory-verbal or facial affect discrimination accuracy and a standard rehabilitation protocol on magnetoencephalographic (MEG) oscillatory brain activity in an auditory paired-click task. SZ were randomly assigned to either 20 daily 1-hour sessions over 4 weeks of auditory-verbal training (N = 19), similarly intense facial affect discrimination training (N = 19), or 4 weeks of treatment as usual (TAU, N = 19). Pre-training, the 57 SZ showed smaller click-induced posterior alpha power modulation than did 28 healthy comparison participants, replicating Popov et al. (2011b). Abnormally small alpha decrease 300-800 ms around S2 improved more after targeted auditory-verbal training than after facial affect training or TAU. The improvement in oscillatory brain dynamics with training correlated with improvement on a measure of verbal learning. Results replicate previously reported effects of neuroplasticity-based psychological training on oscillatory correlates of auditory stimulus differentiation, encoding, and updating and indicate specificity of cortical training effects.Adult Auditory Perception / physiology* Brain / physiopathology Brain Waves / physiology* Facial Recognition / physiology* Female Humans Magnetoencephalography Male Middle Aged Neuronal Plasticity Psychiatric Rehabilitation / methods* Schizophrenia / physiopathology Schizophrenia / rehabilitation* Schizophrenic Psychology* Social Perception* Visual Perception / physiology Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "In a 3-day, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, the behavioral, cognitive, motor, and endocrine effects of 0 mg, 2.5 mg, and 5 mg intravenous Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-9-THC) were characterized in 13 stable, antipsychotic-treated schizophrenia patients. These data were compared with effects in healthy subjects reported elsewhere.\n",
      "Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol transiently increased 1) learning and recall deficits; 2) positive, negative, and general schizophrenia symptoms; 3) perceptual alterations; 4) akathisia, rigidity, and dyskinesia; 5) deficits in vigilance; and 6) plasma prolactin and cortisol. Schizophrenia patients were more vulnerable to Delta-9-THC effects on recall relative to control subjects. There were no serious short- or long-term adverse events associated with study participation.\n",
      "Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol is associated with transient exacerbation in core psychotic and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. These data do not provide a reason to explain why schizophrenia patients use or misuse cannabis. Furthermore, Delta-9-THC might differentially affect schizophrenia patients relative to control subjects. Finally, the enhanced sensitivity to the cognitive effects of Delta-9-THC warrants further study into whether brain cannabinoid receptor dysfunction contributes to the pathophysiology of the cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia.Adult Akathisia, Drug-Induced / physiopathology Arousal / drug effects Cognition / drug effects* Cognition / physiology Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Double-Blind Method Dronabinol / administration & dosage* Endocrine System / drug effects Female Humans Injections, Intravenous / methods Male Mental Recall / drug effects Middle Aged Motor Activity / drug effects* Neuropsychological Tests Perception / drug effects Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Psychotic Disorders Psychotropic Drugs / administration & dosage* Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Schizophrenia / physiopathology Verbal LearningQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Schizophrenia (SZ) is characterized by neurobiological and associated cognitive and functional deficits, including pronounced cortical thinning, that lead to acute and long-term functional impairment. Research with older adults supports the role of non-pharmacological interventions, such as exercise (E) and cognitive training (CT), for cognitive impairments. This literature influenced the development of combined CT&E treatments for individuals with SZ. However, the impact of longer combined treatment duration (6 months) on neuroanatomy has yet to be explored in patients in the early course of the illness. The impact of adding exercise to cognitive training for key brain regions associated with higher-order cognition was examined here using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients.\n",

      "Within an 8-week multisite trial of sertraline v. placebo for depressed adults (n = 216), we examined whether the combination of machine learning with a Personalized Advantage Index (PAI) can generate individualized treatment recommendations on the basis of endophenotype profiles coupled with clinical and demographic characteristics.\n",

Higher depression severity and neuroticism, older age, less impairment in cognitive control, and being employed were each associated with better outcomes to sertraline than placebo.

Although there were no overall outcome differences between treatment groups (d = 0.15), those identified as optimally suited to sertraline at pre-treatment had better week 8 HRSD scores if randomized to sertraline (10.7) than placebo (14.7) (d = 0.58).\n",

      "Patients with schizophrenia have impairment in cognitive-emotional interaction that is reflected in delusion formation and poor social functioning. Although monitoring deficits in the anterior cingulate have been observed in schizophrenia, the involvement of the affective division of the anterior cingulate implicated in cognitive modulation of emotional processing has not been directly addressed in schizophrenia. In this study, we examined the function of the affective division of the anterior cingulate and the related neural systems by using a modified emotional Stroop fMRI paradigm. Fourteen patients with schizophrenia and fourteen healthy controls performed an emotional appraisal task with semantically relevant emotional interferences during fMRI scanning. The patients with schizophrenia were significantly less efficient than the healthy controls during the emotional incongruence trials. When emotionally incongruent trials were compared to congruent trials, relative deactivations of the subgenual cingulate gyrus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex observed in the healthy controls were not found in the patient group and activities of these regions inversely correlated with emotional interference to performance efficiency and response accuracy respectively in the patient group. In addition, relative activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was observed only in the patient group. These findings suggest that deficit in cognitive modulation over emotional interference in patients with schizophrenia may be explained by failure in suppressing the affective division of the anterior cingulate despite attentional effort. This may provide evidence for the failure in suppressing the bottom-up processing of emotion during cognitive-emotional interaction in schizophrenia.Cognition / physiology Emotions / physiology* Female Gyrus Cinguli / pathology Gyrus Cinguli / physiopathology Humans Image Processing, Computer-Assisted / methods Magnetic Resonance Imaging / methods Male Mental Processes / physiology Neuropsychological Tests / statistics & numerical data Prefrontal Cortex / pathology Prefrontal Cortex / physiopathology* Reaction Time / physiology Schizophrenia / pathology Schizophrenia / physiopathology* Task Performance and AnalysisQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "In this study we employed joint independent component analysis (jICA) to perform a novel multivariate integration of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data to investigate the link between function and structure. This model-free approach allows one to identify covariation across modalities with different temporal and spatial scales [temporal variation in MEG and spatial variation in fractional anisotropy (FA) maps]. Healthy controls (HC) and patients with schizophrenia (SP) participated in an auditory/visual multisensory integration paradigm to probe cortical connectivity in schizophrenia. To allow direct comparisons across participants and groups, the MEG data were registered to an average head position and regional waveforms were obtained by calculating the local field power of the planar gradiometers. Diffusion tensor images obtained in the same individuals were preprocessed to provide FA maps for each participant. The MEG/FA data were then integrated using the jICA software (http://mialab.mrn.org/software/fit). We identified MEG/FA components that demonstrated significantly different (p<0.05) covariation in MEG/FA data between diagnostic groups (SP vs. HC) and three components that captured the predominant sensory responses in the MEG data. Lower FA values in bilateral posterior parietal regions, which include anterior/posterior association tracts, were associated with reduced MEG amplitude (120-170 ms) of the visual response in occipital sensors in SP relative to HC. Additionally, increased FA in a right medial frontal region was linked with larger amplitude late MEG activity (300-400 ms) in bilateral central channels for SP relative to HC. Step-wise linear regression provided evidence that right temporal, occipital and late central components were significant predictors of reaction time and cognitive performance based on the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) cognitive assessment battery. These results point to dysfunction in a posterior visual processing network in schizophrenia, with reduced MEG amplitude, reduced FA and poorer overall performance on the MATRICS. Interestingly, the spatial location of the MEG activity and the associated FA regions are spatially consistent with white matter regions that subserve these brain areas. This novel approach provides evidence for significant pairing between function (neurophysiology) and structure (white matter integrity) and demonstrates that this multivariate, multimodal integration technique is sensitive to group differences in function and structure.Adult Brain / pathology Brain / physiopathology Brain Mapping / methods Cognition Disorders / etiology Cognition Disorders / pathology* Cognition Disorders / physiopathology* Data Interpretation, Statistical Diffusion Tensor Imaging / methods* Female Humans Magnetoencephalography / methods* Male Principal Component Analysis Reproducibility of Results Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / pathology* Schizophrenia / physiopathology* Sensitivity and SpecificityQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Cognitive dysfunction is a major feature of bipolar disorder with psychosis and is strongly associated with functional outcomes. Computer-based cognitive remediation has shown promise in improving cognition in patients with schizophrenia. However, despite similar neurocognitive deficits between patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, few studies have extended neuroscience-based cognitive remediation programs to this population.\n",
      "The Treatment to Enhance Cognition in Bipolar Disorder study is an investigator-initiated, parallel group, randomized, blinded clinical trial of an Internet-based cognitive remediation protocol for patients with bipolar disorder I with psychosis (n = 100). We also describe the development of our dose-matched active control paradigm. Both conditions involve 70 sessions of computer-based activities over 24 weeks. The control intervention was developed to mirror the treatment condition in dose and format but without the neuroplasticity-based task design and structure. All participants undergo neuropsychological and clinical assessment at baseline, after approximately 25 hours of study activities, post treatment, and after 6 months of no study contact to assess durability. Neuroimaging at baseline and post treatment are offered in an \"opt-in\" format. The primary outcomes are scores on the MATRICS battery; secondary and exploratory outcomes include measures of clinical symptoms, community functioning, and neuroimaging changes. Associations between change in cognitive measures and change in community functioning will be assessed. Baseline predictors of treatment response will be examined.\n",
      "The present study is the first we are aware of to implement an Internet-based cognitive remediation program in patients with bipolar disorder with psychosis and to develop a comparable web-based control paradigm. The mixed online and study-site format allows accessible treatment while providing weekly staff contact and bridging. Based on user-provided feedback, participant blinding is feasible.\n",

      "Cannabis use can induce acute psychotic symptoms and increase the risk of schizophrenia. Impairments in inhibitory control and processing are known to occur both under the influence of cannabis and in schizophrenia. Whether cannabis-induced impairment in inhibitory processing is related to the acute induction of psychotic symptoms under its influence is unclear. We investigated the effects of acute oral administration of 10mg of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), the main psychoactive ingredient of cannabis, on inhibitory control and regional brain activation during inhibitory processing in humans and examined whether these effects are related to the induction of psychotic symptoms under its influence using a repeated-measures, placebo-controlled, double-blind, within-subject design. We studied thirty-six healthy, English-speaking, right-handed men with minimal previous exposure to cannabis and other illicit drugs twice using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while they performed a response inhibition (Go/No-Go) task. Relative to placebo, delta-9-THC caused transient psychotic symptoms, anxiety, intoxication and sedation, inhibition errors and impaired inhibition efficiency. Severity of psychotic symptoms was directly correlated with inhibition error frequency and inversely with inhibition efficiency under the influence of delta-9-THC. Delta-9-THC attenuated left inferior frontal activation which was inversely correlated with the frequency of inhibition errors and severity of psychotic symptoms and positively with inhibition efficiency under its influence. These results provide experimental evidence that impairments in cognitive processes involved in the inhibitory control of thoughts and actions and inferior frontal function under the influence of cannabis may have a role in the emergence of transient psychotic symptoms under its influence.Area Under Curve Brain / blood supply Brain / drug effects* Chi-Square Distribution Cross-Over Studies Decision Making / drug effects Double-Blind Method Dronabinol / adverse effects* Female Hallucinogens / adverse effects* Humans Image Processing, Computer-Assisted Inhibition, Psychological* Learning Disabilities / chemically induced* Male Oxygen / blood Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Statistics as Topic Time Factors Visual Analog ScaleQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Recent studies indicated that left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may improve clinical status and cognitive functioning in schizophrenia patients. The current study examined the effects of left prefrontal anodal tDCS on symptom-severity and on working memory performance in schizophrenia (SZ) patients. We conducted a double-blind, randomized sham-controlled parallel-group trial. Following baseline clinical and WM assessments, 19 chronic SZ patients were randomly assigned to receive 10 sessions of either active left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) tDCS or sham DLPFC-tDCS across five consecutive days, followed by post-tDCS assessments every four weeks across 12 weeks. Active tDCS significantly alleviated symptom-severity versus baseline and versus sham tDCS. WM-performance improved versus baseline in the active tDCS group. Patients' symptom alleviation was maintained for four weeks after tDCS intervention. Patients' Post-tDCS WM scores were comparable to healthy controls' WM scores. The present findings highlight the benefits of left-prefrontal tDCS interventions and support the association between DLPFC dysfunction and symptom-severity in schizophrenia.Adult Aged Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex / physiology* Double-Blind Method Female Humans Male Memory, Short-Term / physiology* Middle Aged Patient Acuity* Schizophrenia / physiopathology Schizophrenia / therapy* Schizophrenic Psychology* Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation / methods* Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of adjunctive taurine in improving symptomatology and cognition among patients with a DSM-IV first-episode psychotic disorder.\n",
      "121 patients with first-episode psychosis, aged 18-25 years, attending early intervention services consented to participate in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted from January 2007 to May 2009. Patients taking low-dose antipsychotic medication were randomly assigned to receive once-daily taurine 4 g or placebo for 12 weeks. The coprimary outcomes were change in symptomatology (measured by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale [BPRS] total score) and change in cognition (measured by the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia [MATRICS] Consensus Cognitive Battery composite score) at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included tolerability and safety and additional clinical and functioning measures.\n",

      "Relationships between deficits in verbal fluency and poor social functioning have been revealed in patients with schizophrenia. In previous studies, we demonstrated that deficits in idea fluency, which is ranked as a more complex type of verbal fluency and reflects divergent thinking ability, were more closely related to social dysfunction than deficits in simple word fluency. Although functional neuroimaging studies have provided detailed data regarding prefrontal dysfunction during word fluency tasks, the regions that relate to deficits in fluency of ideas and thoughts have not yet been clarified in schizophrenia patients. The purpose of the present study was to identify the prefrontal sub-regions responsible for deficits in idea fluency using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), which is more practical than other imaging methods, and to investigate the relationships between lesions and idea fluency deficits and social dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia. Eighteen outpatients with schizophrenia and 16 healthy subjects were recruited for this case-controlled study. Using 24-channel NIRS, we measured changes in hemoglobin concentration in the prefrontal cortical surface area during idea and letter fluency tests. The analyses revealed that schizophrenia patients generally exhibited a smaller increase in the concentration of oxyhemoglobin in the frontopolar region than the controls during both the tests. However, the areas in which reduced activations were demonstrated in the patients differed remarkably between the idea and letter fluency tests: reduced activations were observed in the ventral region during the former test and in the dorsal region of the frontopolar cortex during the latter test. The reduced activations in each sub-region appeared to affect the related cognitive impairment, since the patients showed significant poorer performances than the controls on both the tests. Moreover, hypoactivity during idea fluency was significantly correlated with poor social functioning as assessed using the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) in the patient group. The results of the present study suggest that the ventral region within the frontopolar cortex is responsible for divergent thinking, which is associated with poor social functioning in patients with schizophrenia.Adult Brain Mapping Case-Control Studies Cognition Disorders / etiology Cognition Disorders / pathology Female Humans Male Neuropsychological Tests Oxyhemoglobins / metabolism* Prefrontal Cortex / metabolism* Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / pathology* Schizophrenic Psychology Social Behavior Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared / methods* Statistics as Topic Thinking / physiology* Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Working memory may be conceptualized as a multi-component system involving the active maintenance and manipulation of stored information in the service of planning/guiding behaviour. Impaired spatial working memory is a robust finding in schizophrenia patients which has been related to an impairment in frontostriatal connectivity. The purpose of this study was to examine the specificity of this impairment by comparing the mnemonic and executive aspects of working memory performance in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with psychotic features, focusing particularly on the functional dynamics between task components. Twenty-four patients with schizophrenia, 14 patients with bipolar I disorder (manic phase) and 33 healthy control subjects were assessed using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB): including the spatial working memory (between search errors and strategy scores) spatial span (storage capacity) and spatial planning (Stockings of Cambridge: accuracy and latency) tasks. Both patient groups were impaired on the spatial span task, which requires the maintenance and retrieval of stored information. In contrast, only schizophrenia patients showed a significant deficit in between search errors, which requires both maintenance and manipulation of information in working memory. That is, they exhibited both a mnemonic and an executive dysfunction. Spatial span was particularly important to accurate planning ability in bipolar patients. In contrast, in patients with schizophrenia poor spatial working memory was a significant predictor of planning impairments, consistent with failures in goal selection, evaluation and/or execution. Furthermore, initial planning time was positively correlated with the latency to complete a planning sequence. This pattern of slow cognitive processing in schizophrenia patients only, resembled that reported previously in patients with basal ganglia disorders. These findings are discussed in terms of a possible common disturbance in fronto-parietal circuitry in the two disorders together with a specific disturbance of fronto-striatal circuitry in schizophrenia, that is not present in bipolar disorder.Adult Bipolar Disorder / psychology* Data Interpretation, Statistical Female Humans Intelligence Tests Male Memory, Short-Term / physiology* Middle Aged Neuropsychological Tests Psychomotor Performance Schizophrenic Psychology* Space Perception / physiology*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Erythropoietin (Epo) has neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects and improves cognitive function in animal models of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric illness. In humans, weekly Epo administration over 3 months improves cognitive function in schizophrenia. The neural underpinnings and time-course of this effect of Epo are currently unknown. It is also unclear whether the cognitive improvement reflects direct neurobiological actions or is secondary to hematological effects. We therefore assessed the actions of single administration of Epo (40,000 IU) vs. saline to healthy volunteers on cognitive and neural measures of executive function using a verbal fluency task and N-back working memory (WM) paradigm during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on day 3 and 7 after administration in two separate cohorts of subjects. Epo modulated neuronal response in a fronto-parietal network during WM performance at both time points; on day 3 after administration, activation was increased in left-hemisphere frontal and cingulate cortex and reduced in the right parietal cortex; in contrast, neural response was enhanced in a right-lateralized fronto-parietal network and reduced in left-side regions 1 week post-administration. In addition, Epo-treated volunteers displayed improved verbal fluency performance 1 week post-administration. These effects occurred in the absence of changes in hematological measures suggesting that they reflect direct neurobiological actions of Epo. The findings are consistent with enduring effects of Epo on neurotrophic signaling and induction of neurochemical changes over time in neural networks typically affected in neuropsychiatric illness. The present study supports the notion that Epo may have clinical applications in the treatment of psychiatric disorder characterized by cognitive dysfunction.Adult Brain Mapping Cerebral Cortex / drug effects* Cerebral Cortex / physiology Cerebrovascular Circulation / drug effects Cerebrovascular Circulation / physiology Cognition / drug effects* Cognition / physiology Cohort Studies Erythropoietin / pharmacology* Erythropoietin / therapeutic use Female Frontal Lobe / drug effects Frontal Lobe / physiology Gyrus Cinguli / drug effects Gyrus Cinguli / physiology Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Memory, Short-Term / drug effects Memory, Short-Term / physiology Nerve Growth Factors / pharmacology Nerve Growth Factors / therapeutic use Nerve Net / drug effects Nerve Net / physiology Neuropsychological Tests Nootropic Agents / pharmacology Nootropic Agents / therapeutic use Parietal Lobe / drug effects Parietal Lobe / physiology Thinking / drug effects* Thinking / physiology Time Time Factors Treatment Outcome Verbal Behavior / drug effects Verbal Behavior / physiologyQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Several studies have implicated herpes simplex virus-type 1 (HSV-1) in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. A recent trial demonstrated that the anti-viral medication valacylovir, which prevents replication of activated HSV-1, improved selected cognitive deficits in people with schizophrenia. In this study, we examined demographic and illness related differences between HSV-1 positive versus HSV-1 negative subjects with early phase schizophrenia and attempted to replicate the previous valacyclovir treatment results in this population.\n",
      "170 subjects with schizophrenia (HSV-1 positive N = 70; HSV-1 negative N = 96) from 12 US sites participated in the HSV-1 positive versus negative comparisons, and were randomized 1:1 to valacyclovir (1.5 g BID) or placebo for a 16-week, double-blind efficacy trial. The primary endpoints were working and verbal memory.\n",
      "The HSV-1 positive group, as compared to the HSV-1 negative group, were older (p < 0.001) with fewer males (p = 0.003), and had a longer duration of illness (p = 0.008), more positive symptoms (p = 0.013), poorer quality of life (p = 0.034) and more impairment on the letter-number sequencing test, which is a measure of working memory (p = 0.045). Valacyclovir failed to significantly improve any of the cognitive indices, symptom or functioning measures.\n",
      "HSV-1 sero-positivity appears to be a marker of a subgroup with a more severe form of schizophrenia. Valacyclovir was not efficacious in the study, perhaps because the herpes virus was in the dormant, non-activated state and therefore non-responsive to valacyclovir effects.

      "The study examined changes in visual attention in schizophrenia following training with a social-cognitive remediation package designed to improve facial emotion recognition (the Micro-Expression Training Tool; METT). Forty out-patients with schizophrenia were randomly allocated to active training (METT; n=26), or repeated exposure (RE; n=14); all completed an emotion recognition task with concurrent eye movement recording. Emotion recognition accuracy was significantly improved in the METT group, and this effect was maintained after one week. Immediately following training, the METT group directed more eye movements within feature areas of faces (i.e., eyes, nose, mouth) compared to the RE group. The number of fixations directed to feature areas of faces was positively associated with emotion recognition accuracy prior to training. After one week, the differences between METT and RE groups in viewing feature areas of faces were reduced to trends. However, within group analyses of the METT group revealed significantly increased number of fixations to, and dwell time within, feature areas following training which were maintained after one week. These results provide the first evidence that improvements in emotion recognition following METT training are associated with changes in visual attention to the feature areas of emotional faces. These findings support the contribution of visual attention abnormalities to emotion recognition impairment in schizophrenia, and suggest that one mechanism for improving emotion recognition involves re-directing visual attention to relevant features of emotional faces.Adult Attention* CD-ROM Computer-Assisted Instruction* Emotions* Eye Movements Facial Expression* Female Fixation, Ocular Humans Male Middle Aged Pattern Recognition, Visual* Psychotic Disorders / diagnosis Psychotic Disorders / psychology Psychotic Disorders / rehabilitation* Reaction Time Recognition, Psychology Remedial Teaching* Schizophrenia / diagnosis Schizophrenia / rehabilitation* Schizophrenic PsychologyQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Stress is known to impair working memory performance. This disruptive effect of stress on working memory has been linked to a decrease in the activity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). In the present experiment, we tested whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the dlPFC can prevent stress-induced working memory impairments. We tested 120 healthy participants in a 2 d, sham-controlled, double-blind between-subjects design. Participants completed a test of their individual baseline working memory capacity on day 1. On day 2, participants were exposed to either a stressor or a control manipulation before they performed a visuospatial and a verbal working memory task. While participants completed the tasks, anodal, cathodal, or sham tDCS was applied over the right dlPFC. Stress impaired working memory performance in both tasks, albeit to a lesser extent in the verbal compared with the visuospatial working memory task. This stress-induced working memory impairment was prevented by anodal, but not sham or cathodal, stimulation of the dlPFC. Compared with sham or cathodal stimulation, anodal tDCS led to significantly better working memory performance in both tasks after stress. Our findings indicate a causal role of the dlPFC in working memory impairments after acute stress and point to anodal tDCS as a promising tool to reduce cognitive deficits related to working memory in stress-related mental disorders, such as depression, schizophrenia, or post-traumatic stress disorder.\n",
      "Working memory deficits are prominent in stress-related mental disorders, such as depression, schizophrenia, or post-traumatic stress disorder. Similar working memory impairments have been observed in healthy individuals exposed to acute stress. So far, attempts to prevent such stress-induced working memory deficits focused mainly on pharmacological interventions. Here, we tested the idea that transcranial direct current stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), a critical neural substrate of working memory, may prevent working memory impairments after stress. Our results indicate that anodal stimulation of the dlPFC may indeed preserve working memory performance under stress, suggesting that the dlPFC plays a causal role in stress-induced working memory deficits and pointing to a potential new avenue to prevent stress-induced cognitive impairments.Adult Analysis of Variance Double-Blind Method Female Humans Hydrocortisone / metabolism Male Memory Disorders / etiology* Memory, Short-Term / physiology* Neuropsychological Tests Prefrontal Cortex / physiology* Saliva / metabolism Stress, Psychological / complications* Time Factors Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation / methods* Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Schizophrenia is associated with perceptual and cognitive dysfunction including impairments in visual attention. These impairments may be related to deficits in early stages of sensory/perceptual processing, particularly within the magnocellular/dorsal visual pathway. In the present study, subjects viewed high and low spatial frequency (SF) gratings designed to test functioning of the parvocellular/magnocellular pathways, respectively. Schizophrenia patients and healthy controls attended to either the low SF (magnocellularly biased) or high SF (parvocellularly biased) gratings. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and recordings of event-related potentials (ERPs) were carried out during task performance. Patients were impaired at detecting low-frequency targets. ERP amplitudes to low-frequency gratings were diminished, both for the early sensory-evoked components and for the attend minus unattend difference component (the selection negativity), which is regarded as a neural index of feature-selective attention. Similarly, fMRI revealed that activity in extrastriate visual cortex was reduced in patients during attention to low, but not high, SF. In contrast, activity in frontal and parietal areas, previously implicated in the control of attention, did not differ between patients and controls. These findings suggest that impaired sensory processing of magnocellularly biased stimuli lead to impairments in the effective processing of attended stimuli, even when the attention control systems themselves are intact.Adult Evoked Potentials, Visual / physiology* Female Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging / methods Male Middle Aged Photic Stimulation / methods* Psychomotor Performance / physiology* Schizophrenia / physiopathology* Visual Cortex / physiopathology* Visual Pathways / physiopathology*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Impaired processing of working memory information is one of the cognitive deficits seen in patients with schizophrenia. This study aims at corroborating the differences in the brain activities involved in the process of working memory between patients with schizophrenia and the controls. Twelve patients with schizophrenia and 11 controls participated in the study. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to assess cortical activities during the performance of a two-back verbal working memory paradigm using the Korean alphabet as mnemonic content. Group analysis revealed that inferior fontal, middle frontal, and superior temporal region showed decreased cortical activities in the patient group compared to those of the controls. This study showed a decreased activation in inferior fontal (BA 47), middle frontal (BA 6), and superior temporal (BA 22/38) neural networks from the patient group and confirmed the earlier findings on the impaired working memory of schizophrenic patients in the fMRI investigation.Adolescent Adult Brain / blood supply Brain / pathology Brain / physiopathology Brain Mapping Female Functional Laterality / physiology Humans Image Processing, Computer-Assisted / methods Magnetic Resonance Imaging* Male Memory Disorders / etiology Memory Disorders / physiopathology* Memory Disorders / psychology Memory, Short-Term / physiology* Middle Aged Motor Skills / physiology Neuropsychological Tests Oxygen / blood Schizophrenia / complications Verbal Learning / physiology* Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Schizophrenia is a neurocognitive illness characterized by behavioral and neural impairments in both early auditory processing and higher order verbal working memory. Previously we have shown intervention-specific cognitive performance improvements with computerized, targeted training of auditory processing (AT) when compared to a computer games (CG) control intervention that emphasized visual processing. To investigate spatiotemporal changes in patterns of neural activity specific to the AT intervention, the current study used magnetoencephalography (MEG) imaging to derive induced high gamma band oscillations (HGO) during auditory encoding, before and after 50 h (∼10 weeks) of exposure to either the AT or CG intervention. During stimulus encoding, AT intervention-specific changes in high gamma activity occurred in left middle frontal and left middle-superior temporal cortices. In contrast, CG intervention-specific changes were observed in right medial frontal and supramarginal gyri during stimulus encoding, and in bilateral temporal cortices during response preparation. These data reveal that, in schizophrenia, intensive exposure to either training of auditory processing or exposure to visuospatial activities produces significant but complementary patterns of cortical function plasticity within a distributed fronto-temporal network. These results underscore the importance of delineating the specific neuroplastic effects of targeted behavioral interventions to ensure desired neurophysiological changes and avoid unintended consequences on neural system functioning.Adult Cognitive Dysfunction / etiology Cognitive Dysfunction / physiopathology* Cognitive Dysfunction / therapy Cognitive Remediation Female Frontal Lobe / physiopathology* Gamma Rhythm / physiology* Humans Magnetoencephalography Male Memory, Short-Term / physiology* Neuronal Plasticity / physiology* Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / physiopathology* Schizophrenia / therapy Speech Perception / physiology* Temporal Lobe / physiopathology*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

One of each pair was randomly designated to either a clinic or home cooking group, with the other assigned to the remaining group.

A multiple regression analysis to control for baseline differences was used to compare the learning of the two groups.\n",
      "Participants in both groups scored significantly higher on the KTA-M after cooking lessons (t = 5.57, df = 21, p < .0001--clinic; t = 7.81. df = 21, p < .0002--home) reflecting learning of cooking skill; there was no statistically significant difference in scores on the KTA-M between the two groups based on where the learning took place (beta = -1.8, df = 42, p < 0.23). Qualitative differences between the learning environments provide suggestions for teaching functional living skills to this population.\n",

The majority have a diagnosis of schizophrenia whose recovery has been delayed due to non-response to first-line treatments, cognitive impairment, negative symptoms and co-existing problems such as substance misuse. These problems contribute to major impairments in social and everyday functioning necessitating lengthy admissions and high support needs on discharge to the community. Engagement in structured activities reduces negative symptoms of psychosis and may lead to improvement in function, but no trials have been conducted to test the efficacy of interventions that aim to achieve this.\n",

      "This is a secondary analysis based on data from a published randomised controlled trial comparing CR+treatment-as-usual (TAU) to TAU alone.

After therapy the CR group showed significant improvement in non-verbal memory, functioning and approaching significance, improvements in executive functions.

Cognitive improvements were associated with massed practice, number of useful strategies and therapeutic alliance, but improvements in functioning were associated only with therapeutic alliance.\n",

      "Increasingly studied, episodic future thought (EFT) impairment negatively affects patients' daily life. Along these lines, working with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS) patients, we documented the clinical effectiveness of a mental visual imagery (MVI)-based facilitation programme on EFT impairment related to executive function difficulties. We aimed at improving the characterisation of the cognitive and neural underpinnings of RR-MS patients' EFT amelioration, by exploring the structural and functional brain changes following the MVI programme. Seventeen non-depressed RR-MS patients were recruited and randomly assigned in the (i) experimental group (n=10), who followed the MVI programme or in the control group (n=7), who followed a verbal control programme. Using an adapted version of the Autobiographical Interview to assess EFT, after facilitation, significant improvement was observed in the experimental group only. This was accompanied by increased activation in the prefrontal region during the generation of future events and was positively correlated with grey matter volume increase in this same brain area. Increased activations in the parahippocampal and the middle temporal gyri were also observed in the experimental group in post-facilitation. Likewise, functional connectivity changes were observed in the posterior brain regions after facilitation. Only minor cerebral changes were observed in the control group, likely reflecting practice effects. Our study showed that EFT improvement following the MVI programme led to functional and structural changes in brain regions sustaining contextual processing, visual imagery, the integration and maintenance of multimodal information. Taken together, these findings suggest that a cognitive intervention focusing on scene construction can be efficient to alleviate EFT impairment related to executive dysfunction. As such, this study opens the way to the development of tailor-made rehabilitation programmes using the different cognitive mechanisms involved in EFT.Adult Brain Mapping Cerebrum / diagnostic imaging Cerebrum / physiopathology* Cognitive Dysfunction / diagnostic imaging Cognitive Dysfunction / etiology Cognitive Dysfunction / physiopathology* Cognitive Dysfunction / rehabilitation* Cognitive Remediation / methods* Executive Function / physiology Female Humans Imagination / physiology Magnetic Resonance Imaging / methods* Male Middle Aged Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting / complications Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting / diagnostic imaging Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting / physiopathology* Thinking / physiology* Treatment Outcome Visual Perception / physiologyQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Recent theoretical and empirical research on schizophrenia converges on the notion that core aspects of the pathophysiology of the disorder may arise from a dysfunction in the coordination of distributed neural activity. Synchronization of neural responses in the beta-band (15-30 Hz) and gamma-band range (30-80 Hz) has been implicated as a possible neural substrate for dysfunctional coordination in schizophrenia. To test this hypothesis, we examined the electroencephalography (EEG) activity in 19 patients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, edition IV criteria, diagnosis of schizophrenia and 19 healthy control subjects during a Gestalt perception task. EEG data were analyzed for phase synchrony and induced spectral power as an index of neural synchronization. Schizophrenia patients were impaired significantly in the detection of images that required the grouping of stimulus elements into coherent object representations. This deficit was accompanied by longer reaction times in schizophrenia patients. Deficits in Gestalt perception in schizophrenia patients were associated with reduced phase synchrony in the beta-band (20-30 Hz), whereas induced spectral power in the gamma-band (40-70 Hz) was mainly intact. Our findings suggest that schizophrenia patients are impaired in the long-range synchronization of neural responses, which may reflect a core deficit in the coordination of neural activity and underlie the specific cognitive dysfunctions associated with the disorder.Action Potentials* Adult Biological Clocks* Brain / physiopathology* Brain Mapping Cognition* Electroencephalography Female Gestalt Theory Humans Male Neurons* Schizophrenia / physiopathology* Visual Perception*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Biomarker-guided treatments are needed in psychiatry, and previous data suggest oxidative stress may be a target in schizophrenia. A previous add-on trial with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) led to negative symptom reductions in chronic patients. We aim to study NAC's impact on symptoms and neurocognition in early psychosis (EP) and to explore whether glutathione (GSH)/redox markers could represent valid biomarkers to guide treatment. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 63 EP patients, we assessed the effect of NAC supplementation (2700 mg/day, 6 months) on PANSS, neurocognition, and redox markers (brain GSH [GSHmPFC], blood cells GSH levels [GSHBC], GSH peroxidase activity [GPxBC]). No changes in negative or positive symptoms or functional outcome were observed with NAC, but significant improvements were found in favor of NAC on neurocognition (processing speed). NAC also led to increases of GSHmPFC by 23% (P = .005) and GSHBC by 19% (P = .05). In patients with high-baseline GPxBC compared to low-baseline GPxBC, subgroup explorations revealed a link between changes of positive symptoms and changes of redox status with NAC. In conclusion, NAC supplementation in a limited sample of EP patients did not improve negative symptoms, which were at modest baseline levels. However, NAC led to some neurocognitive improvements and an increase in brain GSH levels, indicating good target engagement. Blood GPx activity, a redox peripheral index associated with brain GSH levels, could help identify a subgroup of patients who improve their positive symptoms with NAC. Thus, future trials with antioxidants in EP should consider biomarker-guided treatment.Acetylcysteine / administration & dosage Acetylcysteine / pharmacology* Adolescent Adult Antioxidants / administration & dosage Antioxidants / pharmacology* Biomarkers* Cognitive Dysfunction / drug therapy* Cognitive Dysfunction / etiology Cognitive Dysfunction / metabolism Cognitive Dysfunction / physiopathology Double-Blind Method Female Glutathione / drug effects* Glutathione Peroxidase Humans Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Male Outcome Assessment, Health Care* Oxidation-Reduction Prefrontal Cortex / drug effects* Prefrontal Cortex / metabolism Psychotic Disorders / complications Psychotic Disorders / drug therapy* Psychotic Disorders / metabolism Psychotic Disorders / physiopathology Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Schizophrenia / metabolism Schizophrenia / physiopathology Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Schizophrenia is a severe and often detrimental psychiatric disorder. The individual patients' level of functioning is essentially determined by cognitive, particularly working memory (WM), deficits that are critically linked to dysfunctional activity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can transiently modulate activity of the dlPFC and remote areas and has been shown to improve WM functions. It may therefore provide a new, targeted treatment option. For this aim, the present study investigated the effect of anodal tDCS of different intensities on spatial WM in patients with schizophrenia. In two experiments, 32 patients performed a spatial n-back task with increasing WM load (1-, 2-, and 3-back) at baseline and in two sessions with anodal or sham tDCS (EXP I [n = 16]: 1 mA; EXP II [n = 16]: 2 mA) to the right dlPFC (cathode: left m. deltoideus). With 1 mA anodal tDCS, no effect on WM performance could be detected. However, 2 mA anodal tDCS increased accuracy (measured by d') of the task with the highest WM load (3-back). This effect was larger in patients with a lower level of general neurocognitive functioning. These results demonstrate a beneficial effect of 2 mA anodal tDCS on deficient WM accuracy in patients with schizophrenia particularly under challenging conditions and in subjects with higher cognitive impairments. This data will inform future clinical trials on tDCS-enhanced cognitive training to improve treatment of schizophrenia.Adult Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use Cognitive Dysfunction / etiology Cognitive Dysfunction / physiopathology Cognitive Dysfunction / therapy Cross-Over Studies Double-Blind Method Executive Function Female Humans Male Memory, Short-Term* Prefrontal Cortex Schizophrenia / physiopathology Schizophrenia / therapy* Schizophrenic Psychology Spatial Memory* Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation* / adverse effects Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation* / methods Treatment OutcomeQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia has been demonstrated to be dependent, in part, on dopaminergic activity. Clozapine has been found to improve some domains of cognition, including verbal memory, in patients with schizophrenia.\n",
      "This study tested the hypothesis that plasma homovanillic acid (pHVA) levels, a peripheral measure of central dopaminergic activity, would predict the change in memory performance in patients with schizophrenia treated with clozapine.\n",
      "Twenty-seven male patients with schizophrenia received clozapine treatment for 6 weeks. Verbal list learning (VLL)-Delayed Recall (VLL-DR), a test of secondary verbal memory, was administered before and after clozapine treatment. Blood samples to measure pHVA levels were collected at baseline.\n",
      "Baseline pHVA levels were negatively correlated with change in performance on VLL-DR; the lower baseline pHVA level was associated with greater improvement in performance on VLL-DR during treatment with clozapine. Baseline pHVA levels in subjects who showed improvement in verbal memory during clozapine treatment ( n=13) were significantly lower than those in subjects whose memory performance did not improve ( n=14).\n",

      "There is a need for treatments targeting neurocognitive dysfunctions in schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to investigate the neurocognitive effect of aerobic high-intensity interval training (HIIT). A comparison group performed sport simulating active video gaming (AVG). We anticipated that HIIT would improve neurocognition beyond any effect of AVG, due to engagement in higher intensity cardiorespiratory demands. Recent research on the beneficial neurocognitive effect of AVG challenges this expectation but added new relevance to comparing the two interventions. This is an observer-blinded randomized controlled trial. Eighty-two outpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia were allocated to HIIT (n = 43) or AVG (n = 39). Both groups received two supervised sessions per week for 12 weeks. The attrition rate was 31%, and 65% of the participants were defined as protocol compliant study completers. Intention-to-treat analyses showed significant improvements in the neurocognitive composite score from baseline to post-intervention and from baseline to 4 months follow-up in the total sample. The same pattern of results was found in several subdomains. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found no interaction effects of time and group, indicating equal effects in both groups. Separate within-group analysis unexpectedly showed trends of differential effects in the learning domain, as HIIT showed post-intervention improvement in verbal but not visual learning, while AVG showed improvement in visual but not verbal learning. HIIT and AVG improve neurocognition equally, suggesting that both interventions may be applied to target neurocognition in schizophrenia. Future research should investigate trends towards possible differential effects of exercise modes on neurocognitive subdomains.

      "In schizophrenia patients negative symptoms and cognitive impairment often persist despite treatment with second generation antipsychotics leading to reduced quality of life and psychosocial functioning. One core cognitive deficit is impaired working memory (WM) suggesting malfunctioning of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. High frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been used to transiently facilitate or consolidate neuronal processes. Pilot studies using rTMS have demonstrated improvement of psychopathology in other psychiatric disorders, but a systematic investigation of working memory effects outlasting the stimulation procedure has not been performed so far. The aim of our study was to explore the effect of a 3-week high frequency active or sham 10 Hz rTMS on cognition, specifically on working memory, in schizophrenia patients (n=25) in addition to antipsychotic therapy and in healthy controls (n=22). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare activation patterns during verbal WM (letter 2-back task) before and after 3-weeks treatment with rTMS. Additionally, other cognitive tasks were conducted. 10 Hz rTMS was applied over the left posterior middle frontal gyrus (EEG electrode location F3) with an intensity of 110% of the individual resting motor threshold (RMT) over a total of 15 sessions. Participants recruited the common fronto- parietal and subcortical WM network. Multiple regression analyses revealed no significant activation differences over time in any contrast or sample. According to the ANOVAs for repeated measures performance remained without alterations in all groups. This is the first fMRI study that has systematically investigated this topic within a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind design, contrasting the effects in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls.Adult Analysis of Variance Brain / blood supply* Brain Mapping Double-Blind Method Female Humans Image Processing, Computer-Assisted Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Memory Disorders / etiology* Memory Disorders / therapy* Memory, Short-Term / physiology* Middle Aged Neuropsychological Tests Oxygen / blood Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Schizophrenia / complications* Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation / methods* Treatment Outcome Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Hypofrontality is a state of decreased cerebral blood flow in the prefrontal cortex during executive function performance; it is commonly observed in patients with schizophrenia. Cognitive dysfunction, as well as the psychological symptoms of schizophrenia, influences the ability of patients to reintegrate into society. The current study investigated the effects of an interactive sports video game (IVG; Nintendo Wii™ Sports Resort) on frontal lobe function of patients with schizophrenia. A sample of eight patients (6 male and 2 female; mean age = 46.7 years, standard deviation (SD) = 13.7) engaged in an IVG every week for 3 months in a controlled, single-blind, crossover study. Before and after the intervention we examined frontal lobe blood-flow volume using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and assessed functional changes using the Frontal Assessment Battery, Health-Related Quality of Life scale, and behaviorally-assessed physical function tests. fNIRS revealed that prefrontal activity during IVG performance significantly increased in the IVG period compared with the control period. Furthermore, significant correlations between cerebral blood flow changes in different channels were observed during IVG performance. In addition, we observed intervention-related improvement in health-related quality of life following IVG. IVG intervention was associated with increased prefrontal cortex activation and improved health-related quality of life performance in patients with schizophrenia. Patients with chronic schizophrenia are characterized by withdrawal and a lack of social responsiveness or interest in others. Interventions using IVG may provide a useful low-cost rehabilitation method for such patients, without the need for specialized equipment.Adult Cross-Over Studies Female Humans Male Middle Aged Quality of Life Schizophrenia / rehabilitation* Single-Blind Method Sports* Video Games*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Executive Functioning (EF) is an important factor for community functioning for people with severe mental illness. Cognitive remediation programs often improve EF, but do so by using multiple therapeutic techniques. Little is known regarding how individual treatment elements promote cognitive improvement. Oscillatory brain activity is a potential neurophysiological mechanism that may change as a result of targeted training on computerized exercises. The current study aimed to examine the effects of a brief EF training program on EEG and neurocognitive measures.\n",
      "25 people with severe mental illness were randomized to either 2weeks of computerized EF training or control training. Training consisted of 1h training sessions 3 times per week and 40min of daily home training. Assessments examined EEG theta and alpha band oscillatory power during EF tasks and neurocognitive measures of EF.\n",
      "EF training resulted in greater frontal theta power and reduced posterior alpha power during computerized EF tasks than control training. Power in the alpha frequency band over frontal electrode sites did not significantly differ between the two groups as a result of training. Additionally, participants in the EF training experienced significantly greater improvement in EF ability as measured by neurocognitive tests than the control condition.\n",

      "The present double-blind crossover study examines the effects of cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in controls and in an analogue population to psychosis: individuals reporting elevated symptoms of nonclinical psychosis (NCP). A total of 18 controls and 24 NCP individuals were randomized into conditions consisting of 25 minutes of anodal (active) or sham cerebellar tDCS. Following this, both groups completed a pursuit rotor task designed to measure procedural learning performance. Participants then returned 1-week later and received the corresponding condition (either active or sham) and repeated the pursuit rotor task. Results indicate that in the sham condition, control participants showed significantly greater rates of motor learning when compared with the NCP group. In the active condition, the NCP group exhibited significant improvements in the rate of motor learning and performed at a level that was comparable to controls; these data support the link between cerebellar dysfunction and motor learning. Taken together, tDCS may be a promising treatment mechanism for patient populations and a useful experimental approach in elucidating our understanding of psychosis.Adolescent Adult Cerebellum / physiopathology* Cognitive Dysfunction / etiology Cognitive Dysfunction / physiopathology Cognitive Dysfunction / therapy* Cross-Over Studies Double-Blind Method Female Humans Learning / physiology* Male Motor Activity / physiology* Psychomotor Performance / physiology* Psychotic Disorders / complications Psychotic Disorders / physiopathology Psychotic Disorders / therapy* Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / physiopathology Schizophrenia / therapy* Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation / methods* Treatment Outcome Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Obesity is a serious medical problem that disproportionately affects people with severe mental illness. Behavioral strategies aimed at lifestyle modification have proven effective for weight loss in general population but have not been studied adequately among persons with schizophrenia. We have conducted a randomized controlled pilot trial of an established weight loss program, modified for this specific population, and supplemented with a novel food replacement program, as well as practical, community based teaching of shopping and preparing healthy food. The program not only arrested weight gain, and produced meaningful weight loss, but also weight loss continued 6 months after the intervention is completed. Cognitive impairment had no bearing to the extent a participant benefited from the program. As a conclusion, well designed simple behavioral programs can produce lasting weight loss for patients with schizophrenia and comorbid obesity, improve metabolic indices, and possibly decrease significant medical risks associated with obesity.Adult Blood Glucose / metabolism Body Weight* Energy Intake* Exercise Feeding Behavior* Female Humans Male Obesity / physiopathology* Obesity / prevention & control Pilot Projects Psychotic Disorders / complications Psychotic Disorders / diet therapy Psychotic Disorders / physiopathology Sample Size Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / diet therapy* Schizophrenia / physiopathologyQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Cognitive deficits are a major determinant of social and occupational dysfunction in schizophrenia. In this study, we determined whether neurocognitive enhancement therapy (NET) in combination with work therapy (WT) would improve performance on neuropsychological tests related to but different from the training tasks.\n",
      "Sixty-five patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were randomly assigned to NET plus WT or WT alone. Neurocognitive enhancement therapy included computer-based training on attention, memory, and executive function tasks; an information processing group; and feedback on cognitive performance in the workplace. Work therapy included paid work activity in job placements at the medical center (eg, mail room, grounds, library) with accompanying supports. Neuropsychological testing was performed at intake and 5 months later.\n",
      "Prior to enrollment, both groups did poorly on neuropsychological testing. Patients receiving NET + WT showed greater improvements on pretest-posttest variables of executive function, working memory, and affect recognition. As many as 60% in the NET + WT group improved on some measures and were 4 to 5 times more likely to show large effect-size improvements. The number of patients with normal working memory performance increased significantly with NET + WT, from 45% to 77%, compared with a decrease from 56% to 45% for those receiving WT.\n",
      "Computer training for cognitive dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia can have benefits that generalize to independent outcome measures. Efficacy may result from a synergy between NET, which encourages mental activity, and WT, which allows a natural context for mental activity to be exercised, generalized, and reinforced.Adult Attention / physiology Cognition / physiology* Cognition Disorders / diagnosis Cognition Disorders / psychology Cognition Disorders / therapy* Computer-Assisted Instruction / methods Dichotic Listening Tests / methods Feedback Female Frontal Lobe / physiology Humans Male Memory / physiology Multivariate Analysis Neuropsychological Tests / statistics & numerical data* Occupational Therapy / methods* Psychomotor Performance / physiology Psychotic Disorders / diagnosis Psychotic Disorders / psychology Psychotic Disorders / therapy Schizophrenia / therapy* Schizophrenic Psychology Teaching / methods* Treatment OutcomeQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "High rates of tobacco smoking and smoking cessation failure in schizophrenia may be related to prefrontal cortical dysfunction. Novel treatment options for tobacco use disorder are needed given the limited efficacy of current pharmacotherapies. Preliminary evidence suggests high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) may suppress tobacco craving in smokers with schizophrenia. The goal of this study was to determine effects of rTMS for tobacco craving and cognition using a short-term (3-day) human laboratory paradigm.\n",
      "Bilateral active (20Hz) versus sham rTMS stimulation was administered in a counterbalanced, double-blind, cross-over design to thirteen smokers with schizophrenia and n=14 non-psychiatric smoking controls. Participants were studied at baseline (smoking satiated), after 16h of smoking abstinence, and after smoking reinstatement. Primary outcome measures included tobacco craving, withdrawal and cognition.\n",
      "Overnight abstinence produced a significant increase in tobacco craving and withdrawal, and impaired verbal memory and visuospatial working memory in both diagnostic groups; these effects were reversed with smoking reinstatement. However, active rTMS did not modify this pattern of results. Moreover, active versus sham rTMS had no significant effects on cognitive outcomes, and was not associated with significant adverse events.\n",
      "Our preliminary findings suggest that short-term rTMS administration may not be sufficient enough to modify cognition, craving, and withdrawal outcomes in smokers with schizophrenia (NCT00736710).

      "Patients with schizophrenia demonstrate significant impairments of early visual processing, potentially implicating dysfunction of the magnocellular visual pathway. The present study evaluates transient visual evoked potential (tVEP) responses to stimuli biased toward the magnocellular (M) or parvocellular (P) systems in patients with schizophrenia vs. normal volunteers first to evaluate relative contributions of M and P systems to specific tVEP components in schizophrenia and, second, to evaluate integrity of early M and P processing in schizophrenia.\n",
      "Seventy-four patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder were compared with 59 control subjects using separate stimuli to assess the tVEP response to M, P and mixed M/P conditions. Stimuli were biased toward M vs. P processing by manipulation of chromatic and achromatic contrast. C1, P1, N1 and P2 components were compared between patients and controls. All subjects showed 20/32 vision or better.\n",
      "Waveforms were obtained to low contrast (M), chromatic contrast (P) and high contrast (mixed M/P) stimuli in both patients and controls. C1 was present to P and mixed M/P stimuli. Patients showed a significant reduction in amplitude and an increase in latency of the C1 component. P1 was elicited primarily by M and mixed M/P stimuli, whereas N1 was elicited primarily by P and mixed M/P stimuli. Patients showed reductions in both P1 and N1 amplitudes across conditions. However, only reductions in P1 amplitude survived covariation for between group differences in visual acuity. Further, P1 amplitude reductions in the M condition correlated with a proxy measure of global outcome.\n",
      "M- and P-selective stimuli elicit differential components of the tVEP. Patients with schizophrenia show significant reductions in response even to simple visual stimuli. Deficits, particularly within the M system, may correlate significantly with global outcome and level of community functioning.\n",
      "Whereas deficits in high-order cognitive processing have been extensively documented in schizophrenia, integrity of early-stage sensory processing has been studied to a lesser degree. The present findings suggest that deficits in early-stage visual processing are significantly related to overall clinical outcome in schizophrenia.

      "Cognitive impairment has been proposed to be the core feature of schizophrenia (Sz). Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive form of brain stimulation which can improve cognitive function in healthy participants and in psychiatric patients with cognitive deficits. tDCS has been shown to improve cognition and hallucination symptoms in Sz, a disorder also associated with marked sensory processing deficits. Recent findings in healthy controls demonstrate that anodal tDCS increases auditory deviance detection, as measured by the brain-based event-related potential, mismatch negativity (MMN), which is a putative biomarker of Sz that has been proposed as a target for treatment of Sz cognition. This pilot study conducted a randomized, double-blind assessment of the effects of pre- and post-tDCS on MMN-indexed auditory discrimination in 12 Sz patients, moderated by auditory hallucination (AH) presence, as well as working memory performance. Assessments were conducted in three sessions involving temporal and frontal lobe anodal stimulation (to transiently excite local brain activity), and one control session involving 'sham' stimulation (meaning with the device turned off, i.e., no stimulation). Results demonstrated a trend for pitch MMN amplitude to increase with anodal temporal tDCS, which was significant in a subgroup of Sz individuals with AHs. Anodal frontal tDCS significantly increased WM performance on the 2-back task, which was found to positively correlate with MMN-tDCS effects. The findings contribute to our understanding of tDCS effects for sensory processing deficits and working memory performance in Sz and may have implications for psychiatric disorders with sensory deficits.Acoustic Stimulation Adolescent Adult Contingent Negative Variation / physiology* Double-Blind Method Electroencephalography Female Humans Male Memory Disorders / etiology* Memory Disorders / therapy* Memory, Short-Term / physiology* Middle Aged Neuropsychological Tests Pilot Projects Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Reaction Time / physiology Schizophrenia / complications* Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation / methods* Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Successful linguistic processing requires efficient encoding of successively-occurring auditory input in a time-constrained manner, especially under noisy conditions. In this study we examined the early neural response dynamics to rapidly-presented successive syllables in schizophrenia participants and healthy comparison subjects, and investigated the effects of noise on these responses. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to reveal the time-course of stimulus-locked activity over bilateral auditory cortices during discrimination of syllable pairs that differed either in voice onset time (VOT) or place of articulation (POA), in the presence or absence of noise. We also examined the association of these early neural response patterns to higher-order cognitive functions. The M100 response, arising from auditory cortex and its immediate environs, showed less attenuation to the second syllable in patients with schizophrenia than healthy comparison subjects during VOT-based discrimination in noise. M100 response amplitudes were similar between groups for the first syllable during all three discrimination conditions, and for the second syllable during VOT-based discrimination in quiet and POA-based discrimination in noise. Across subjects, the lack of M100 attenuation to the second syllable during VOT-based discrimination in noise was associated with poorer task accuracy, lower education and IQ, and lower scores on measures of Verbal Learning and Memory and Global Cognition. Because the neural response to the first syllable was not significantly different between groups, nor was a schizophrenia-related difference obtained in all discrimination tasks, early linguistic processing dysfunction in schizophrenia does not appear to be due to general sensory input problems. Rather, data suggest that faulty temporal integration occurs during successive syllable processing when the signal-to-noise ratio is low. Further, the neural mechanism by which the second syllable is suppressed during noise-challenged VOT discrimination appears to be important for higher-order cognition and provides a promising target for neuroscience-guided cognitive training approaches to schizophrenia.Acoustic Stimulation Adult Analysis of Variance Attention / physiology Auditory Pathways / physiopathology Auditory Perception / physiology* Brain / physiopathology* Brain Mapping Cognition / physiology* Evoked Potentials, Auditory / physiology* Female Humans Language* Longitudinal Studies Magnetoencephalography Male Middle Aged Neuropsychological Tests Reaction Time / physiology Schizophrenia / physiopathology* Schizophrenic Psychology Time FactorsQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Individuals with schizophrenia display substantial neurocognitive deficits for which available treatments offer only limited benefits. Yet, findings from studies of animals, clinical and nonclinical populations have linked neurocognitive improvements to increases in aerobic fitness (AF) via aerobic exercise training (AE). Such improvements have been attributed to up-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). However, the impact of AE on neurocognition, and the putative role of BDNF, have not been investigated in schizophrenia. Employing a proof-of-concept, single-blind, randomized clinical trial design, 33 individuals with schizophrenia were randomized to receive standard psychiatric treatment (n = 17; \"treatment as usual\"; TAU) or attend a 12-week AE program (n = 16) utilizing active-play video games (Xbox 360 Kinect) and traditional AE equipment. Participants completed assessments of AF (indexed by VO2 peak ml/kg/min), neurocognition (MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery), and serum-BDNF before and after and 12-week period. Twenty-six participants (79%) completed the study. At follow-up, the AE participants improved their AF by 18.0% vs a -0.5% decline in the TAU group (P = .002) and improved their neurocognition by 15.1% vs -2.0% decline in the TAU group (P = .031). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that enhancement in AF and increases in BDNF predicted 25.4% and 14.6% of the neurocognitive improvement variance, respectively. The results indicate AE is effective in enhancing neurocognitive functioning in people with schizophrenia and provide preliminary support for the impact of AE-related BDNF up-regulation on neurocognition in this population. Poor AF represents a modifiable risk factor for neurocognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia for which AE training offer a safe, nonstigmatizing, and side-effect-free intervention.Adult Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor / blood* Cognition Disorders* / blood Cognition Disorders* / etiology Cognition Disorders* / therapy Exercise / physiology Exercise Therapy / methods* Female Humans Male Middle Aged Physical Fitness / physiology Schizophrenia* / blood Schizophrenia* / complications Schizophrenia* / therapy Single-Blind Method Treatment Outcome Video GamesQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Cognitive dysfunction is a core symptom dimension in bipolar disorder and a strong predictor of functional outcomes. Cognitive remediation (CR) produces moderate, durable effects on cognition in patients with schizophrenia; however, studies of CR in patients with bipolar disorder are sparse and findings have been mixed. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of CR versus active control in patients with bipolar disorder with psychosis.\n",
      "Patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder with psychosis (n = 75) were randomized to a 70-hour computerized CR program or a dose-matched computer control using a parallel design with 1:1 allocation between July 2011 and November 2015. Cognition (primary outcome) and clinical and community functioning (secondary outcomes) were assessed at baseline, at treatment midpoint (after 20-25 hours of training), posttreatment, and at durability (after 6 months of no study contact). Participants and assessment staff were blind to group membership.\n",
      "75 participants were randomly assigned to a treatment group, and 72 participants initiated the active phase of treatment and were included in the primary, intent-to-treat analysis (CR: n = 39; Control: n = 33). Linear mixed effects models examining the effects of CR versus Control at posttreatment showed medium to large effects of CR on processing speed (d = 0.42), visual learning and memory (d = 0.92), and the composite (d = 0.80). Superiority of CR over Control on processing speed (d = 0.65) and composite (d = 0.83) was maintained or increased at durability. CR was not associated with change in community functioning, although cognitive change was associated with functional change across the sample.\n",
      "Cognitive remediation produced significant improvements over an active control in several cognitive domains and the cognitive composite. While both groups improved on several domains relative to baseline, durability of gains was unique to CR.\n",

      "Sixty patients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to 16-weeks of Outdoor Cycling (OC) (n = 30, 50% male; mean age, 38.7 ± 10.1) or Occupational Therapy (OT) (n = 30, 50% male; mean age, 39.0 ± 8.6). OC and OT involved one 90-min group session per week. OC consisted of structured exercise programs and OT addressed daily living skills. Primary outcome measurements were mental health variables, such as Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Beck's Depression Inventory, State and Trait Anxiety Inventory, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Global Assessment of Functioning and executive function (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, WCST). Secondary measures were the adherence and PA. PA was measured by responding to the Physical Activity Scale (K-PASE) and wearing a pedometer for 2 days.\n",
      "Repeated measures ANOVA revealed improved psychotic symptoms (p = .014), depression (p = .007), state (p = .031) and trait anxiety (p = .002) and global functions (p = .024) in the OC group compared with OT group. The OC group showed increased correct rates (p = .022) and categories completed (p = .033) in the WCST. There was no difference in total K-PASE score between groups; however, there was a significant improvement in the number of daily steps in the OC group compared with the OT group (p = .030).\n",

      "Reduced amplitude of the P300 event-related brain potential (ERP) is a robust finding in schizophrenia. It remains unclear whether this represents a state or trait abnormality. We previously reported reductions of specific subcomponents of the auditory oddball P300 that were independent of acute symptomatology and were differentially associated with gender and deficit/nondeficit subtype. To clarify the state vs. trait nature of these abnormalities, we reassessed a subset of these patients after a minimum interval of 1 year following initial study.\n",
      "Auditory P300 ERPs were obtained from 18 patients at two time points and compared to baseline normative data recorded from 48 controls. Five P300 subcomponents were identified using current source density measures: frontal (P3f), bilateral parietal (P3pL, P3pR), and bilateral temporal (P3tL, P3tR).\n",
      "Patients exhibited reduced P300 amplitudes at baseline, including specific reductions of left temporal and right parietal subcomponents. There were no significant changes in P300 amplitudes over time, despite significant improvement in symptomatology, and the parietal subcomponent exhibited persistent impairment. There was, however, a trend toward normalization of the left temporal subcomponent that correlated with change in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. There was also a highly significant inverse relationship between changes in frontal P300 subcomponent amplitude and severity of auditory hallucinations (r = -.76).\n",
      "The findings support the overall longitudinal stability of P300 deficits in schizophrenia, though there is some state-dependent modulation of these deficits. The relationship between the frontal P300 and hallucinations is consistent with both the cognitive orienting function of this subcomponent and the role of the anterior cingulate as a hypothesized generator of this ERP activity.Adolescent Adult Event-Related Potentials, P300 / physiology* Female Humans Longitudinal Studies Male Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Schizophrenia / physiopathology* Schizophrenic PsychologyQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "This study examined the link between executive function and functional outcome in schizophrenia to identify useful psychological intervention targets and explore how executive function changes affect social functioning and symptoms. Participants from two randomized controlled trials (n = 63) with poor social functioning, positive and negative symptoms, and cognitive impairment completed seven measures of executive function. Three cognitive factors were extracted: verbal working memory, response inhibition speed, and stimulus-driven responding. Participants received individual cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) (n = 18), a control therapy (occupational therapy activities) (n = 14), or treatment as usual (n = 19). Only the CRT group improved on verbal working memory. No group improved on the other factors. Although verbal working memory was significantly associated with social functioning and symptom severity 3 months after baseline, change in this factor did not predict change in either functional outcome. There was a significant interaction between group and the stimulus-driven responding factor, and for the CRT group only, a change to a more externally focused responding style was associated with reduced social problems and symptoms. Regardless of treatment type, increased response inhibition speed was associated with reduced negative symptoms. Stimulus-driven responding and response inhibition speed may therefore make useful targets for intervention.Adolescent Adult Cognition Disorders / etiology Cognition Disorders / psychology* Cognition Disorders / rehabilitation* Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Female Humans Male Memory Middle Aged Schizophrenia / rehabilitation* Severity of Illness Index Social Behavior* Treatment OutcomeQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Cognitive deficits are a major determinant of social and occupational dysfunction in schizophrenia, and new treatments are needed that address these impairments. The current study determined whether neurocognitive enhancement therapy (NET) in combination with work therapy (WT) would show improvement in performance on neuropsychological tests that endured 6 months after completion of training. A total of 145 participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were randomly assigned to NET + WT or WT alone. NET included computer-based training on attention, memory, and executive function tasks. WT included paid work activity in job placements at the medical center. Neuropsychological assessment was performed at baseline, at the end of the 6-month active intervention, and 12 months after training began. Repeated measures multivariate analyses of variance revealed greater neuropsychological improvements on working memory (p < 0.05) and executive function (p < 0.05) for the NET + WT group over the 12 months. Both groups showed sustained improvements on verbal and nonverbal memory.Adult Attention / physiology Cognition / physiology* Cognition Disorders / etiology Cognition Disorders / psychology Cognition Disorders / rehabilitation Cognitive Behavioral Therapy / methods* Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Male Neuropsychological Tests Psychomotor Performance / physiology Rehabilitation, Vocational / methods* Remedial Teaching / methods* Retrospective Studies Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / physiopathology Schizophrenia / rehabilitation* Schizophrenic Psychology Time Factors Treatment Outcome Work / psychology*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Cognitive impairment in multiple domains is common in patients with schizophrenia and may be a powerful determinant of poor functional ability and quality of life. We report a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of donepezil augmentation in a schizoaffective disorder patient stabilized on olanzapine pharmacotherapy. The patient showed significant improvements in several cognitive measures and increased activation of prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia on functional MRI during the donepezil augmentation. In addition, the donepezil augmentation resulted in a reduction of depressive symptoms and in significant improvements in functional abilities and quality of life.

      "Reduced amplitudes of auditory evoked P300 are a robust finding in schizophrenic patients, indicating deficient attentional resource allocation and active working memory. Delta9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta9-THC), the main active constituent of Cannabis sativa, has been known to acutely impair cognitive abilities in several domains, particularly in memory and attention. Given the psychotic-like effects of Delta9-THC, a cannabinoid hypothesis of schizophrenia has been proposed. This prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study investigated the acute effects of cannabinoids on P300 amplitude in 20 healthy volunteers (age 28.2+/-3.1 years, 10 male) by comparing Delta9-THC and standardized cannabis extract containing Delta9-THC and cannabidiol (CBD). P300 waves were recorded during a choice reaction task. As expected, Delta9-THC revealed a significant reduction of P300 amplitude at midline frontal, central, and parietal electrodes. CBD has been known to abolish many of the psychotropic effects of Delta9-THC, but, unexpectedly, failed to demonstrate a reversal of Delta9-THC-induced P300 reduction. Moreover, there were no correlations between cannabinoid plasma concentrations and P300 parameters. These data suggest that Delta(9)-THC may lead to acute impairment of attentional functioning and working memory. It can be speculated whether the lack of effect of CBD may be due to an insufficient dose used or to an involvement of neurotransmitter systems in P300 generation which are not influenced by CBD.Acoustic Stimulation / methods Administration, Oral Adult Cannabidiol / pharmacology Cannabis / chemistry Double-Blind Method Dronabinol / administration & dosage* Electroencephalography / methods Event-Related Potentials, P300 / drug effects* Evoked Potentials, Auditory / drug effects* Female Humans Male Multivariate Analysis Prospective Studies Psychophysics Psychotropic Drugs / administration & dosage* Reaction Time / drug effectsQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Asymmetrical topography of the auditory P300 with reduced left hemispheric amplitudes and, consequently, a right-lateralized peak of the P300 electrical field has been repeatedly reported in schizophrenia. This was interpreted as an indication of reduced left-hemispheric activity during the simple cognitive P300 task. Since generator locations calculated from the surface potentials are ambiguous, further evidence is required to support this conclusion. In the present study, 13 stabilized DSM-III-R schizophrenic patients were studied with an auditory P300 paradigm and neuropsychological methods sensitive to functional brain asymmetries. The tests included the verbal paired associates test (Goldstein et al 1988, Cortex 24:41-52) and the nonspatial conditional associative learning test (Petrides 1985, Neuropsychologia 23:601-614). A significant correlation was found between right-sided lateralization of the P300 maximal positivity and neuropsychological evidence for left hemispheric temporal- hippocampal dysfunction. Attentional performance was correlated with P300 amplitudes. The results of this study provide further evidence that right-sided lateralization of the P300 peaks results from dysfunction of left-hemispheric neuronal generators.Acoustic Stimulation Adult Attention / physiology Event-Related Potentials, P300 / physiology* Female Functional Laterality / physiology Humans Intelligence Tests Male Neuropsychological Tests* Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Schizophrenia / physiopathology* Schizophrenic Psychology*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Several efforts to develop pharmacological treatments with a beneficial effect on cognition in schizophrenia are underway, while cognitive remediation has shown modest effects on cognitive performance. Our goal was to test if pharmacological augmentation of cognitive training would result in enhancement of training-induced learning. We chose modafinil as the pharmacological augmenting agent, as it is known to have beneficial effects on learning and cognition. 49 participants with chronic schizophrenia were enroled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study across two sites and were randomised to either modafinil (200mg/day) or placebo. All participants engaged in a cognitive training program for 10 consecutive weekdays. The primary outcome measure was the performance on the trained tasks and secondary outcome measures included MATRICS cognitive battery, proxy measures of everyday functioning and symptom measures. 84% of the participants completed all study visits. Both groups showed significant improvement in the performance of the trained tasks suggesting potential for further learning. Modafinil did not induce differential enhancement on the performance of the trained tasks or any differential enhancement of the neuropsychological and functional measures compared to placebo. Modafinil showed no significant effects on symptom severity. Our study demonstrated that combining pharmacological compounds with cognitive training is acceptable to patients and can be implemented in large double-blind randomised controlled trials. The lack of differential enhancement of training-induced learning raises questions, such as choice and optimal dose of drug, cognitive domains to be trained, type of cognitive training, intervention duration and chronicity of illness that require systematic investigation in future studies.Adult Benzhydryl Compounds / adverse effects Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use* Chemotherapy, Adjuvant / adverse effects Chemotherapy, Adjuvant / methods Chronic Disease Cognitive Behavioral Therapy / methods* Double-Blind Method Female Humans Male Modafinil Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Psychotropic Drugs / adverse effects Psychotropic Drugs / therapeutic use* Schizophrenia / therapy* Schizophrenic Psychology Severity of Illness Index Treatment OutcomeQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia have major functional impacts. Modafinil is a cognitive enhancer whose effect in healthy volunteers is well-described, but whose effects on the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia appear to be inconsistent. Two possible reasons for this are that cognitive test batteries vary in their sensitivity, or that the phase of illness may be important, with patients early in their illness responding better.\n",
      "A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled single-dose crossover study of modafinil 200 mg examined this with two cognitive batteries [MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) and Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB)] in 46 participants with under 3 years' duration of DSM-IV schizophrenia, on stable antipsychotic medication. In parallel, the same design was used in 28 age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy volunteers. Uncorrected p values were calculated using mixed effects models.\n",
      "In patients, modafinil significantly improved CANTAB Paired Associate Learning, non-significantly improved efficiency and significantly slowed performance of the CANTAB Stockings of Cambridge spatial planning task. There was no significant effect on any MCCB domain. In healthy volunteers, modafinil significantly increased CANTAB Rapid Visual Processing, Intra-Extra Dimensional Set Shifting and verbal recall accuracy, and MCCB social cognition performance. The only significant differences between groups were in MCCB visual learning.\n",
      "As in earlier chronic schizophrenia studies, modafinil failed to produce changes in cognition in early psychosis as measured by MCCB. CANTAB proved more sensitive to the effects of modafinil in participants with early schizophrenia and in healthy volunteers. This confirms the importance of selecting the appropriate test battery in treatment studies of cognition in schizophrenia.Adolescent Adult Benzhydryl Compounds / administration & dosage Benzhydryl Compounds / pharmacology* Cognitive Dysfunction / drug therapy* Cognitive Dysfunction / etiology Cognitive Dysfunction / physiopathology* Cross-Over Studies Double-Blind Method Female Healthy Volunteers Humans Male Modafinil Neuropsychological Tests* Nootropic Agents / administration & dosage Nootropic Agents / pharmacology* Outcome Assessment, Health Care* Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / physiopathology* Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Modafinil, a novel cognitive enhancer, selectively improves neuropsychological task performance in healthy volunteers and adult patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It has been argued that persistent cognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia are responsible for the failure of many patients to rehabilitate socially even when psychotic symptoms are in remission. The present study examined the potential of modafinil as a cognitive enhancer in schizophrenia. Twenty chronic patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were entered into a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study using a 200 mg dose of modafinil. Modafinil had some cognitive enhancing properties in schizophrenia similar to those observed in healthy adults and adult patients with ADHD. Improvement was seen on short-term verbal memory span, with trends towards improved visual memory and spatial planning. This was accompanied by slowed response latency on the spatial planning task. No effect on stop-signal performance was seen. Importantly, significant improvement in attentional set shifting was seen, despite no effect of modafinil on this task being seen in healthy volunteers or ADHD patients. Modafinil may have potential as an important therapy for cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia, particularly because of its beneficial effects on attentional set shifting.Adult Analysis of Variance Attention / drug effects* Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity / drug therapy Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity / etiology Benzhydryl Compounds / pharmacology Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use* Case-Control Studies Chi-Square Distribution Chronic Disease Cognition / drug effects* Cognition Disorders / drug therapy Cognition Disorders / etiology Cross-Over Studies Double-Blind Method Female Humans Male Memory, Short-Term / drug effects Middle Aged Modafinil Neuroprotective Agents / pharmacology Neuroprotective Agents / therapeutic use* Neuropsychological Tests / statistics & numerical data Pattern Recognition, Visual Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Reaction Time / drug effects Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Spatial Behavior / drug effectsQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Targeted cognitive training (TCT) of auditory processing enhances higher-order cognition in schizophrenia patients. TCT performance gains can be detected after 1 training session. As a prelude to a potential clinical trial, we assessed a pharmacological augmentation of cognitive therapy (PACT) strategy by testing if the psychostimulant, amphetamine, augments TCT gains in auditory processing speed (APS) in schizophrenia patients and healthy subjects (HS). HS and schizophrenia patients were tested in a screening session (test 1), followed by a double-blind crossover design (tests 2-3), comparing placebo vs amphetamine (10 mg; 7 d between tests). On each test day, 1 hour of Posit Science \"Sound Sweeps\" training was bracketed by 2- to 4-minute pre- and post-training assessments of APS. Training consisted of a speeded auditory time-order judgment task of successive frequency modulation sweeps. Auditory system \"learning\" (APS post- vs pre-training) was enhanced by amphetamine (main effect of drug: P < .002; patients: d = 0.56, P < .02; HS: d = 0.39, nonsignificant), and this learning was sustained for at least 1 week. Exploratory analyses assessed potential biomarker predictors of sensitivity to these effects of amphetamine. Amphetamine enhances auditory discrimination learning in schizophrenia patients. We do not know whether gains in APS observed in patients after 1 hour of TCT predict clinical benefits after a full course of TCT. If amphetamine can enhance the therapeutic effects of TCT, this would provide strong support for a \"PACT\" treatment paradigm for schizophrenia.Adult Amphetamine / administration & dosage Amphetamine / pharmacology* Auditory Perception / physiology* Central Nervous System Stimulants / administration & dosage Central Nervous System Stimulants / pharmacology* Cognitive Dysfunction / drug therapy* Cognitive Dysfunction / etiology Cognitive Dysfunction / rehabilitation* Cognitive Remediation / methods* Combined Modality Therapy Cross-Over Studies Discrimination, Psychological / physiology* Double-Blind Method Female Humans Male Middle Aged Outcome Assessment, Health Care* Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / rehabilitation*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

We therefore predicted that the PREE should be reduced, through decreased resistance to extinction in the partial reinforcement (PR) condition, in various types of individual: (a) healthy volunteers given low doses of oral amphetamine; (b) those in the acute (but not chronic) phase of a schizophrenic illness and; (c) healthy volunteers with high scores on personality measures of schizotypy. Despite obtaining robust demonstrations of PREE in all experiments, none of these predictions were confirmed. A single, low dose, of amphetamine had no effect on either continuous reinforcement (CR) or partial reinforcement (PR). Acute and chronic schizophrenic patients showed a reduced PREE compared to controls. However this was due to increased resistance to extinction in the CR groups. Finally, high schizotypy scores were associated with greater PREE, attributable to both decreased extinction in the CR condition and increased extinction in the PR condition. The results of these experiments on human PREE provide no support that PREE is a valid paradigm with which to explore the cognitive dysfunction underlying schizophrenia.Acute Disease Adult Amphetamine / blood Amphetamine / pharmacology* Central Nervous System Stimulants / blood Central Nervous System Stimulants / pharmacology* Chronic Disease Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Extinction, Psychological / drug effects* Female Humans Male Personality Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Reinforcement Schedule* Schizophrenic Psychology*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Amphetamine sensitisation (AS) is an established animal model of the hypersensitivity to psychostimulants seen in patients with schizophrenia. AS also models the dysregulation of mesolimbic dopamine signalling which has been implicated in the development of psychotic symptoms. Recent data suggest that the enhanced excitability of mesolimbic dopamine neurons in AS is driven by a hyperactivity of hippocampal (subiculum) neurons, consistent with a strong association between hippocampal dysfunction and schizophrenia. While AS can be modelled in human volunteers, its functional consequences on dopaminoceptive brain regions (i.e. striatum and hippocampus) remains unclear. Here we describe the effects of a sensitising dosage pattern of dextroamphetamine on the neural correlates of motor sequence learning in healthy volunteers, within a randomised, double-blind, parallel-groups design. Behaviourally, sensitisation was characterised by enhanced subjective responses to amphetamine but did not change performance (i.e. learning rate) during an explicit sequence learning task. In contrast, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements showed that repeated intermittent amphetamine exposure was associated with increased blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal within the medial temporal lobe (MTL) (subiculum/entorhinal cortex) and midbrain, in the vicinity of the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA) during sequence encoding. Importantly, MTL hyperactivity correlated with the sensitisation of amphetamine-induced attentiveness. The MTL-midbrain hyperactivity reported here mirrors observations in sensitised rodents and is consistent with contemporary models of schizophrenia and behavioural sensitisation. These findings of meso-hippocampal hyperactivity during AS thus link pathophysiological concepts of dopamine dysregulation to cognitive models of psychosis.Attention / drug effects Attention / physiology Central Nervous System Sensitization / drug effects* Central Nervous System Sensitization / physiology* Central Nervous System Stimulants / pharmacology Dextroamphetamine / pharmacology* Double-Blind Method Functional Neuroimaging Healthy Volunteers Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging Memory / drug effects Memory / physiology* Mesencephalon / drug effects Mesencephalon / physiology* Serial Learning / drug effects Serial Learning / physiology Temporal Lobe / drug effects Temporal Lobe / physiology*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Impairment in mismatch negativity (MMN) potentials is a robust finding in schizophrenia. While previous studies suggested that MMN in man is generated by a single dipole source bilaterally in the primary auditory cortex, more recent data modified this assumption by showing differential modulation of MMN components over the frontal and temporal scalp. Here we used a roving standard experiment to record mismatch potentials to tone duration deviants with the aim to detect robust temporal and frontal mismatch components. Fourteen schizophrenic patients with normal intelligence and without overt cognitive deficits and age- and sex-matched controls were studied. In agreement with previous findings MMN recorded from the frontal scalp was markedly attenuated in patients. However, in contrast to previous reports, positive mismatch potentials of normal magnitude were recorded from temporal (mastoid) electrodes. This finding raises the possibility of a selective impairment in multiple mismatch generators in schizophrenia and may lend support for the notion of impaired cortico-cortical connectivity in schizophrenia.Acoustic Stimulation Adult Cognition Electroencephalography* Evoked Potentials, Auditory / physiology* Female Frontal Lobe / physiopathology* Humans Male Neuropsychological Tests Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Schizophrenia / physiopathology* Schizophrenic Psychology Temporal Lobe / physiopathology*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia. Previous studies have indicated that exposure to neurotropic infectious agents such as Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 may contribute to cognitive deficits and neuroanatomical abnormalities in individuals with schizophrenia. We examined the association between exposure to neurotropic infectious agents and cognitive function in 1308 participants in the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) trial. This sample included all of the individuals in the CATIE trial for whom baseline blood samples were available. Cognition was evaluated at baseline by a test battery which yielded composite scores in the domains of processing speed, verbal memory, vigilance, reasoning, and working memory as well as a summary neurocognitive score. Solid phase immunoassay techniques were used to measure IgG class antibodies to Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 (HSV-1), Herpes Simplex Virus type 2 (HSV-2), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and to Toxoplasma gondii (T gondii) in the sera of the study individuals. We found a significant association between the neurocognitive summary score and antibodies to HSV-1 but not to HSV-2, CMV, or T. gondii. There was also a significant association between HSV-1 exposure and the Verbal Memory, Vigilance, and Processing Speed composite scores. HSV-1 may modulate the neurocognitive function of individuals with schizophrenia through its ability to establish latency in the central nervous system and undergo periodic reactivation. A better understanding of the role of HSV-1 may lead to better methods of treatment for the cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia.Analysis of Variance Antibodies, Viral / blood* Antipsychotic Agents Cognition Disorders* / blood Cognition Disorders* / etiology Cognition Disorders* / virology Double-Blind Method Female Herpesvirus 1, Human / immunology* Humans Immunoassay Immunoglobulin G / blood Male Memory Disorders / blood Memory Disorders / etiology Memory Disorders / virology Neuropsychological Tests Perphenazine Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Random Allocation Schizophrenia / blood Schizophrenia / complications* Schizophrenia / drug therapyQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Cognitive impairments cause significant functional issues for people with schizophrenia, often emerging before the onset of hallucinations, delusions and other psychosis symptoms. Current pharmacological treatments do not target cognitive dysfunction. Several lines of evidence support the beneficial effects of estrogens on cognition. Raloxifene hydrochloride, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, has been associated with cognitive improvements in healthy postmenopausal women and in schizophrenia, although findings are inconsistent. Using pooled data from two clinical trials, the aim of the current study was to compare the efficacy of 120 mg/day adjunctive raloxifene to placebo for 12 weeks on cognitive performance in women with schizophrenia who were stratified by menopause status (pre-menopausal; peri-menopausal or post-menopausal). A total of sixty-nine participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were included. Cognition was assessed at baseline and study end using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Results indicated that after stratifying for menopause status (strata) and adjusting for endogenous hormone levels (estrogen, progesterone, follicle stimulating hormone and luteinising hormone), semantic fluency, picture naming and list recognition change from baseline scores for the raloxifene group differed significantly from the placebo group. The findings from the current study highlight the importance of considering menopause status when interpreting the effects of hormonal treatments.Adult Cognition / drug effects* Drug Therapy, Combination Estrogen Replacement Therapy / methods Female Humans Menopause* / drug effects Menopause* / psychology Middle Aged Postmenopause / drug effects Postmenopause / psychology Premenopause / drug effects Premenopause / psychology Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Raloxifene Hydrochloride / therapeutic use* Retrospective Studies Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Schizophrenia / physiopathology Schizophrenic Psychology Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators Treatment OutcomeQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "An impaired capacity to filter or 'gate' sensory information is a core deficit in cognitive function associated with schizophrenia. These deficits have been linked in part to N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor dysfunction. An association between high levels of glycine, a positive allosteric modulator of the NMDA receptor, and sensorimotor gating impairments (i.e. prepulse inhibition (PPI) deficit) have been reported in animal models of schizophrenia as well as patients with schizophrenia. This study examined the acute effects of modulating the glycine site of the NMDA receptor (with high-dose glycine) on sensory gating as measured by PPI. Sixteen healthy male subjects (final sample size of 12) participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design in which each subject was tested under two acute treatment conditions separated by at least a 5-day washout period; placebo and 0.8 g/kg glycine. PPI was recorded 45 min post treatment using electromyography of the eye-blink response. Relative to placebo, high-dose glycine significantly impaired sensorimotor gating as demonstrated by a decrease in PPI (t(11) = -2.983, p < 0.05). Administration of a high dose of glycine is associated with impairments in PPI supporting earlier observations in animals and patients with schizophrenia. This result, when taken together with findings in patients, suggests that high synaptic levels of glycine may have some clinically relevant detrimental effects and suggests a potential dissociation of clinical symptomatology and sensory information processing as a function of NMDA receptor modulation in schizophrenia.Adolescent Adult Attention / drug effects Cross-Over Studies Double-Blind Method Glycine / pharmacology* Humans Male Middle Aged Prefrontal Cortex / drug effects Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate / drug effects Reflex, Startle / drug effects* Sensory Gating / drug effects*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "There is a pressing need for new classes of treatment for psychosis. A key therapeutic target for novel compounds is the NMDA receptor, which may be modulated by nitric oxide donors such as sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Recent studies of SNP in patients with psychosis have mixed results, and the drug has to be administered intravenously. Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) is a well-established cardiovascular medicine that is also a nitric oxide donor, and can be given orally.\n",

      "This was a single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from December 2016 to April 2019 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02906553). Patients received 3 × sprays of GTN or placebo for three consecutive days, and were re-assessed on Days 1, 2, 3 and 7. The primary outcome was cognition (Jumping to Conclusions task), secondary outcomes were symptoms (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)), verbal memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning task), and mood (Bond-Lader Visual Analogue Scales).\n",
      "Nineteen patients were randomised, and 13 participants were included in the analyses. Compared with placebo, GTN was well tolerated, but was not associated with significant effects on cognition, symptoms, or mood. Bayesian statistics indicate that our results were 2× more likely under the null hypothesis than the alternative hypothesis, providing anecdotal evidence that GTN does not improve psychotic symptoms.\n",

      "Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia have been hypothesized to reflect N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction. However, the mechanisms through which the NMDAR contributes to individual cognitive functions differ. To explore how NMDAR signaling relates to specific cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, we tested the effects of enhancing NMDAR signaling on working memory and experience-dependent plasticity using d-cycloserine (DCS). Plasticity was assessed using an EEG paradigm that utilizes high-frequency visual stimulation (HFvS) to induce neural potentiation, and 2 learning tasks, the information integration (IIT) and weather prediction (WPT) tasks. Working memory was assessed using an N-back task. Forty-five schizophrenia patients were randomized to receive a single 100 mg DCS dose (SZ-DCS; n = 24) or placebo (SZ-PLC; n = 21) in a double-blind, between-groups design. Testing occurred on a single day after placebo or DCS administration; baseline values were not obtained. DCS did not affect plasticity, as indicated by similar neural potentiation, and similar IIT and WPT learning between groups. However, among patients who successfully engaged in the working memory task (ie, performed above chance), SZ-DCS (n = 17) showed superior 2-back performance compared to SZ-PLC (n = 16). Interestingly, SZ-DCS also showed larger pre-HFvS neural responses during the LTP task. Notably, this pattern of DCS effects is the opposite of those found in our prior study of healthy adults. Results are consistent with target engagement of the NMDAR by DCS, but suggest that NMDAR signaling was not translated into synaptic plasticity changes in schizophrenia. Results highlight the importance of considering how distinct NMDAR-associated processes contribute to individual cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.Adolescent Adult Cognitive Dysfunction / drug therapy Cognitive Dysfunction / etiology Cognitive Dysfunction / metabolism* Cognitive Dysfunction / physiopathology* Cycloserine / administration & dosage Cycloserine / pharmacology* Double-Blind Method Electroencephalography Evoked Potentials, Visual / drug effects Evoked Potentials, Visual / physiology* Female Humans Male Memory, Short-Term / drug effects Memory, Short-Term / physiology* Neuronal Plasticity / drug effects Neuronal Plasticity / physiology* Nootropic Agents / administration & dosage Nootropic Agents / pharmacology* Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate / drug effects* Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate / metabolism* Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / metabolism* Schizophrenia / physiopathology* Signal Transduction / drug effects Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Reduced brain N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) has been repeatedly found in chronic schizophrenia and suggests neuronal loss or dysfunction. However, the potential confounding effect of antipsychotic drugs on NAA has not been resolved. We studied 32 minimally treated schizophrenia patients and 21 healthy subjects with single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) of the frontal and occipital lobes, caudate nucleus, and cerebellum. Concentrations of NAA, Choline, and Cre were determined and corrected for the proportion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the voxel. Patients were treated in a randomized-controlled double-blind manner with either haloperidol or quetiapine. (1)H-MRS was repeated every 6 months for up to 2 years. There was a group main effect for baseline NAA with lower global NAA in schizophrenia subjects before treatment compared to healthy controls. Global NAA was directly related to measures of global cognitive performance in the whole subject sample. Following treatment with haloperidol or quetiapine, there were no changes in NAA in any of the regions studied. Early in the illness, schizophrenia patients already demonstrate subtle reductions in NAA. Treatment with typical or atypical antipsychotic medications for several months does not result in NAA changes.Adolescent Adult Antipsychotic Agents / pharmacology* Aspartic Acid / analogs & derivatives* Aspartic Acid / analysis Aspartic Acid / metabolism Brain / drug effects* Brain / metabolism* Brain / physiopathology Brain Chemistry / drug effects Brain Chemistry / physiology Brain Mapping Choline / metabolism Cognition / drug effects Cognition / physiology Dibenzothiazepines / pharmacology Double-Blind Method Female Haloperidol / pharmacology Humans Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Male Protons Quetiapine Fumarate Schizophrenia / diagnosis Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Schizophrenia / metabolism* TimeQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a noninvasive technique used in different medical fields. It has been applied in different medical areas such as wound healing, traumatic brain injuries, neurological disorders, cognitive disorders, Alzheimer's disease, pain, and arthritis, with different results. We studied the effectiveness of LLLT on cognitive impairment in patients with chronic schizophrenia. A randomized controlled double-blind clinical trial was performed in a men's chronic treatment center, in Razi Psychiatric Hospital, in Tehran, Iran. We screened the cognitive impairment by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was also used to assess the patients' positive and negative symptoms. Seventeen consenting patients were randomly allocated to the treatment arm, and 15 to the sham treatment control arm. The mean age of the control and treated patients was 49.47 ± 6.99 and 50.24 ± 7.69, respectively. No significant difference in PANSS and MMSE test scores was detected in both groups after the 6th session and after 2 months of follow-up after laser therapy. The positive and negative scales and agitation and excitement levels did not change significantly in either group. Nevertheless, the depression/anxiety subscale in the PANSS test showed a significant reduction after 6 sessions but did not persist after 2 months. No improvement in cognitive impairment or the positive and negative symptoms was detected after LLLT in patients with chronic schizophrenia.

      "Cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) effectively reduces neurocognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia, but few studies have used structural neuroimaging methods to assess its neuroanatomical effects. We investigated these effects, as well as the association between changes in cortical volume and neurocognitive performance.\n",
      "Between August 2013 and September 2016, we performed a randomized controlled study comprising a CRT group (16 individuals) and a treatment-as-usual (TAU) group (15 individuals) of patients with schizophrenia. CRT participants engaged in twice-weekly computer-assisted CRT sessions and weekly group meetings for 12 weeks. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was performed before and after the intervention period, and whole-brain voxel-based morphometric analysis was used to detect significant cortical gray matter volume changes. We also assessed the correlation between cortical volume changes and CRT-derived neurocognitive improvements.\n",
      "The CRT group exhibited significantly greater improvements than the TAU group in verbal fluency (P = 0.012) and global cognitive scores (P = 0.049). The CRT group also exhibited significantly greater increases in right hippocampal volume than the TAU group (P < 0.001).

      "The development of effective cognitive training (CT) interventions is critical for improving the daily lives of people with schizophrenia. At this point, it is unclear whether a so-called \"bottom-up\" or \"top-down\" CT approach is more beneficial for inducing cognitive gains and generalization in this population. The aims of this randomized controlled trial were to: 1) Compare the effects of these two types of training approaches on performance-based (MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery, MCCB) and neurophysiological (mismatch negativity, MMN) measures of cognition, and 2) Evaluate MMN as a potential predictor of treatment response. Ninety-nine patients with persistent schizophrenia (mean age of 51 and illness duration of 30 years) were randomly assigned in a 2:2:1 ratio to a \"bottom-up\" intervention that selectively targets basic auditory processing and verbal learning (Brain Fitness), a \"top-down\" intervention that targets a broad range of higher-order cognitive functions (COGPACK), or a control condition consisting of commercial computer games (Sporcle). Participants completed on average 30 h of training over 12 weeks. Despite demonstrated improvement on training tasks, we found no significant treatment effects on measures of neurocognition (MCCB), MMN, or functional capacity from either intervention. Interestingly, there was an association between an enhanced MMN response at 6 weeks and improved reasoning/problem solving at 12 weeks in the COGPACK group. Although this study had several methodological strengths, the results were mainly negative. It suggests that CT trials in schizophrenia should try to better understand mediators and moderators of treatment response to develop more personalized interventions.Adult Auditory Perception* / physiology Cognitive Dysfunction / etiology Cognitive Dysfunction / physiopathology Cognitive Dysfunction / rehabilitation* Cognitive Remediation / methods* Female Humans Male Middle Aged Outcome Assessment, Health Care Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / physiopathology Schizophrenia / rehabilitation* Verbal Learning* / physiologyQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Reduced thalamic volume is consistently observed in schizophrenia, and correlates with cognitive impairment. Targeted cognitive training (TCT) of auditory processing in schizophrenia drives improvements in cognition that are believed to result from functional neuroplasticity in prefrontal and auditory cortices. In this study, we sought to determine whether response to TCT is also associated with structural neuroplastic changes in thalamic volume in patients with early schizophrenia (ESZ). Additionally, we examined baseline clinical, cognitive, and neural characteristics predictive of a positive response to TCT. ESZ patients were randomly assigned to undergo either 40 h of TCT (N=22) or a computer games control condition (CG; N=22 s). Participants underwent MRI, clinical, and neurocognitive assessments before and after training (4-month interval). Freesurfer automated segmentation of the subcortical surface was carried out to measure thalamic volume at both time points. Left thalamic volume at baseline correlated with baseline global cognition, while a similar trend was observed in the right thalamus. The relationship between change in cognition and change in left thalamus volume differed between groups, with a significant positive correlation in the TCT group and a negative trend in the CG group. Lower baseline symptoms were related to improvements in cognition and left thalamic volume preservation following TCT. These findings suggest that the cognitive gains induced by TCT in ESZ are associated with structural neuroplasticity in the thalamus. Greater symptom severity at baseline reduced the likelihood of response to TCT both with respect to improved cognition and change in thalamic volume.Auditory Perception Cognition Disorders / diagnostic imaging Cognition Disorders / pathology Cognition Disorders / therapy Cognitive Behavioral Therapy* Female Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Memory, Short-Term Neuronal Plasticity Organ Size Schizophrenia / diagnostic imaging* Schizophrenia / pathology Schizophrenia / therapy* Schizophrenic Psychology Thalamus / diagnostic imaging* Thalamus / pathology Treatment Outcome Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Although extensive resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) changes have been reported in schizophrenia, rsFC changes of the frontal pole (FP) remain unclear. The FP contains several subregions with different connection patterns; however, it is unknown whether the FP subregions are differentially affected in schizophrenia. To explore this possibility, we compared rsFC differences of the FP subregions between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls.\n",
      "One hundred healthy controls and 91 patients with schizophrenia underwent resting-state functional MRI with a sensitivity-encoded spiral-in (SENSE-SPIRAL) imaging sequence to reduced susceptibility-induced signal loss and distortion. The FP was subdivided into the orbital (FPo), medial (FPm), and lateral (FPl) subregions. Mean fMRI time series were extracted for each FP subregion and entered into a seed-based rsFC analysis.\n",
      "The FP subregions exhibited differential rsFC patterns in both healthy controls and schizophrenia patients. Direct comparison between groups revealed reduced rsFCs between the bilateral FPl and several cognitive-related regions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, temporal cortex and inferior parietal lobule in schizophrenia. Although the FPl exhibited obvious atrophy, rsFC changes were unrelated to volumetric atrophy in the FPl, to duration of illness, and to antipsychotic medication dosage. No significant differences were observed in the rsFCs of other FP subregions.\n",
      "These findings suggest a selective (the lateral subregion) functional disconnection of the FP subregions in schizophrenia.Adult Antipsychotic Agents / administration & dosage* Female Frontal Lobe* / diagnostic imaging Frontal Lobe* / physiopathology Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging* Male Radiography Schizophrenia* / diagnostic imaging Schizophrenia* / drug therapy Schizophrenia* / physiopathologyQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Ninety-one outpatients with schizophrenia were evaluated for DIP and other EPS. Subjective cognitive-perceptual dysfunction was comprehensively assessed using the Frankfurt Complaint Questionnaire (FCQ).

      "Previous studies have demonstrated that alcohol consumption impairs neuroplasticity in the motor cortex. However, it is unknown whether alcohol produces a similar impairment of neuroplasticity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a brain region that plays an important role in cognitive functioning. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of alcohol intoxication on neuroplasticity in the DLPFC. Paired associative stimulation (PAS) combined with electroencephalography (EEG) was used for the induction and measurement of associative LTP-like neuroplasticity in the DLPFC. Fifteen healthy subjects were administered PAS to the DLPFC following consumption of an alcohol (1.5 g/l of body water) or placebo beverage in a within-subject cross-over design. PAS induced neuroplasticity was indexed up to 60 minutes following PAS. Additionally, the effect of alcohol on PAS-induced potentiation of theta-gamma coupling (an index associated with learning and memory) was examined prior to and following PAS. Alcohol consumption resulted in a significant impairment of mean (t = 2.456, df = 13, p = 0.029) and maximum potentiation (t = -2.945, df = 13, p = 0.011) compared to the placebo beverage in the DLPFC and globally. Alcohol also suppressed the potentiation of theta-gamma coupling by PAS. Findings from the present study provide a potential neurophysiological mechanism for impairment of cognitive functioning by alcohol.Adult Alcoholic Intoxication / etiology Alcoholic Intoxication / pathology* Central Nervous System Depressants / adverse effects Cross-Over Studies Ethanol / adverse effects* Evoked Potentials, Motor / drug effects* Female Humans Male Middle Aged Neuronal Plasticity* Prefrontal Cortex / drug effects Prefrontal Cortex / pathology* Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "A lack of insight into illness and negative attitudes towards medication are common among individuals with schizophrenia and impact clinical outcomes. This study aimed to examine the relationships between attitudes towards medication and cognitive function in schizophrenia patients. Thirty-five male forensic inpatients who were suffering from chronic schizophrenia participated in the study. A drug attitude inventory was used to evaluate the attitudes of the patients towards medication. Neuropsychological function was assessed with a comprehensive battery of tests. Patients with positive attitudes towards medication performed significantly better than those with negative attitudes on tests of verbal working memory (digit span forwards and backwards), inhibition and set shifting (Penn Inhibition test), delayed object memory and overall mental status (Mini Mental State Examination). There were no differences in age, education, hospitalizations or clinical symptoms between the groups. Our findings support an association between negative attitudes towards medication and poor cognitive performance, particularly of working memory.Adult Antipsychotic Agents / adverse effects* Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use Attitude Cognition / drug effects Humans Male Memory Disorders / chemically induced* Memory Disorders / psychology* Memory, Short-Term / drug effects* Neuropsychological Tests Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Schizophrenic Psychology*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "The present 12-week open-label uncontrolled trial was aimed to explore the efficacy of reboxetine add-on pharmacotherapy on clinical symptoms and cognitive functioning in 15 patients with schizophrenia with suboptimal response (mean [SD] Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale baseline total score, 32.2 [5.4]) despite receiving clozapine monotherapy at the highest tolerated dosage. The results obtained evidenced that reboxetine at a dosage of 4 mg/d mildly reduced only depressive symptoms (Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia: P = 0.035, Cohen d = 0.7), whereas worsening of performances on phonemic fluency (P = 0.012, Cohen d = 0.5) was observed. After Bonferroni correction, changes at the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia and at the Verbal Fluency Task were not further confirmed.The results obtained indicate that reboxetine seemed to be scarcely effective for reducing clinical symptoms in patients with schizophrenia who have had an incomplete clinical response to clozapine. Regarding cognitive functioning, in our sample, a trend to experience cognitive impairment in the examined domains was observed, as confirmed by a mild worsening of performances on cognitive tasks.Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder with regard to pathophysiology; therefore, data reflecting the mean response of a sample of patients may fail to reveal therapeutic effects. More research is needed to better identify subgroups of patients with peculiar features, which may account for responsivity to experimental medications and augmentation strategies.Adult Antipsychotic Agents / adverse effects Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use Clozapine / therapeutic use* Cognition Disorders / chemically induced Drug Therapy, Combination / adverse effects Female Humans Male Morpholines / adverse effects Morpholines / therapeutic use* Pilot Projects Reboxetine Schizophrenia / drug therapy*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Chronic cannabis use may interact with factors, such as age of onset of cannabis use, family history, and genetic factors, to elicit schizophrenia (SZ)-like symptoms, including sensory and cognitive deficits. However, evidence of a relationship between cannabis use and cognitive impairment is confounded by concomitant use of tobacco. The objective of this study was to compare tobacco-naïve cannabis users with individuals without a history of tobacco/cannabis use on the auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) event-related potential (ERP), a neural measure of auditory deviance detection which is diminished in SZ. An exploratory arm of the study, conducted within a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled design, examined the acute effects of nicotine gum (6mg) on MMN in cannabis users. MMN was recorded in response to 5 deviant stimuli within an optimal MMN paradigm in 44 healthy, non-tobacco smoking volunteers aged 18-26. Cannabis users (n=21) started smoking cannabis prior to age 17, at least 1 joint per month. To examine the effects of chronicity, users were grouped into relatively heavy long-term (HLT; n=11) users and light short-term (LST; n=10) users. Impaired deviance detection was shown in cannabis users vs. nonusers as reflected by a smaller MMN to duration deviants. Chronicity of use was also associated with MMN alterations, as HLTs displayed a reduced duration and gap MMN vs. LSTs. Compared with placebo, nicotine treatment enhanced select MMN deviants in cannabis user subgroups. As deficits associated with early and persistent cannabis use are similar to those seen in SZ, these dose-dependant disturbances in early sensory processing with cannabis use may be one cognitive pathway which mediates an increased risk for SZ in vulnerable youth, and be influenced by concurrent cigarette smoking behavior.Acoustic Stimulation Adolescent Adult Auditory Perceptual Disorders / chemically induced Auditory Perceptual Disorders / complications Auditory Perceptual Disorders / physiopathology* Case-Control Studies Double-Blind Method Evoked Potentials, Auditory / drug effects Evoked Potentials, Auditory / physiology Female Humans Male Marijuana Abuse / complications Marijuana Abuse / physiopathology* Nicotine / administration & dosage* Nicotine / adverse effects* Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Cognitive deficits that characterize schizophrenia are present in the prodrome, worsen with illness onset, and predict functional outcome. Cognitive dysfunction is thus a critical target for early intervention in young individuals with recent onset schizophrenia.\n",
      "This 2-site double-blind randomized controlled trial investigated cognitive training of auditory processing/verbal learning in 86 subjects with recent onset schizophrenia (mean age of 21 years). Subjects were given laptop computers to take home and were asked to perform 40 hours of training or 40 hours of commercial computer games over 8 weeks. We examined cognitive measures recommended by the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia initiative (MATRICS), symptoms, and functioning. We also assessed baseline reward anticipation to index motivational system functioning and measured changes in auditory processing speed after 20 hours of training to assess target engagement.\n",
      "Auditory training subjects demonstrated significant improvements in global cognition, verbal memory, and problem solving compared with those of computer games control subjects. Both groups showed a slight but significant decrease in symptoms and no change in functional outcome measures. Training-induced cognitive gains at posttraining showed significant associations with reward anticipation at baseline and with improvement in auditory processing speed at 20 hours.\n",
      "Neuroscience-informed cognitive training via laptop computer represents a promising treatment approach for cognitive dysfunction in early schizophrenia. An individual's baseline motivational system functioning (reward anticipation), and ability to engage in auditory processing speed improvement, may represent important predictors of treatment outcome. Future studies must investigate whether cognitive training improves functioning and how best to integrate it into critical psychosocial interventions.Adolescent Adult Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use* Auditory Perception* Cognition Disorders / etiology Cognition Disorders / psychology Cognition Disorders / therapy* Cognitive Behavioral Therapy / methods* Combined Modality Therapy Double-Blind Method Female Humans Male Memory Neuronal Plasticity* Problem Solving Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / therapy* Schizophrenic Psychology* Therapy, Computer-Assisted / methods* Treatment Outcome Verbal Learning* Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Weight gain is commonly observed with olanzapine treatment. Zonisamide is an antiepileptic drug associated with weight loss. This study examined the effectiveness of zonisamide in preventing weight gain in 42 patients beginning olanzapine for bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Each patient had a body mass index of 22 mg/kg or greater and was randomized to taking olanzapine with either zonisamide (n = 20) or placebo (n = 22) for 16 weeks. The primary outcome measure was change in body weight in kilograms from baseline. In the primary analysis using longitudinal regression, patients who received zonisamide had a significantly slower rate of weight gain and increase in body mass index than those who received placebo. The patients treated with zonisamide gained a mean (SD) of 0.9 (3.3) kg, whereas those treated with placebo gained a mean (SD) of 5.0 (5.5) kg; P = 0.01. None of the patients in the zonisamide group, compared with 7 patients (33%) in the placebo group, gained 7% of body weight or greater from baseline (Fisher exact test, P = 0.009). The zonisamide group, however, reported significantly more cognitive impairment as an adverse event than the placebo group (25% vs 0, respectively; P = 0.02). Zonisamide was effective for mitigating weight gain in patients with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia initiating treatment with olanzapine but was associated with cognitive impairment as an adverse event.Adult Anticonvulsants / adverse effects Anticonvulsants / pharmacology Anticonvulsants / therapeutic use* Antipsychotic Agents / adverse effects* Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use Benzodiazepines / adverse effects* Benzodiazepines / therapeutic use Bipolar Disorder / drug therapy Cognition Disorders / chemically induced Double-Blind Method Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Isoxazoles / adverse effects Isoxazoles / pharmacology Isoxazoles / therapeutic use* Male Middle Aged Olanzapine Regression Analysis Schizophrenia / drug therapy Treatment Outcome Weight Gain / drug effects* Young Adult ZonisamideQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Antipsychotics (APs) are the cornerstone of treatment for schizophrenia (SCZ) but are unfortunately associated with serious metabolic adverse effects including weight gain and type 2 diabetes. The pathophysiology of AP-induced metabolic dysfunction is largely undetermined. Brain insulin resistance has been posited to be at the cross-roads of many cognitive and metabolic disorders, and disruption of central insulin action has emerged as a possible explanatory mechanism underlying AP induced metabolic dysfunction. Previous studies suggest that change in neuroimaging-based parameters with intranasal insulin administration can be leveraged to investigate brain insulin resistance. In this proof-of-concept study, we will utilize neural signatures of insulin action in the brain to examine if APs disrupt brain insulin signaling. It is hypothesized that: 1) intranasal insulin (INI), but not intranasal placebo (INP), will change cerebral blood flow and resting state connectivity, as well as increase glutamate levels in the striatum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; 2) oral olanzapine (OLA), but not oral placebo (PL), will inhibit the effect of INI on these parameters. Thirty-two healthy volunteers will undergo a single blind, cross-over design, wherein all participants receive the following four treatment combinations, 2-6 weeks apart, in a random sequence: INP + PL, INP + OLA, INI + PL, and INI + OLA. Participants will undergo an MRI-based assay of brain insulin resistance 15 minutes after administering 160 IU INI or INP. The scanning protocol includes resting and task-based functional MRI, arterial spin labelling, and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Demonstrating that OLA can acutely induce brain insulin resistance is clinically relevant to metabolic health in SCZ. Evidence of brain insulin resistance induced by acute AP dosing can inform the early use of adjunctive insulin sensitizers for the treatment of metabolic comorbidities associated with AP treatment in severe mental illness.

      "Chronic benzodiazepine use is common in patients with mental illness and is associated with cognitive impairment. It is unclear whether benzodiazepine-induced cognitive impairment is reversible. Amelioration of cognitive dysfunction may be facilitated during benzodiazepine tapering by add-on melatonin due to its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. We examined how melatonin and benzodiazepine withdrawal affect cognition, subjective well-being, and psychosocial functioning. Eighty patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder were randomized to add-on treatment once daily with either prolonged-release melatonin or placebo in a 24-week, double-blind clinical trial. All participants gradually tapered usual benzodiazepine dosage in a closely monitored treatment setting. We used the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) to assess neurocognitive performance with additional assessments of subjective well-being and psychosocial functioning. BACS composite and subscale scores (except motor speed) significantly improved in parallel with benzodiazepine dose reduction, but there was no additional effect of melatonin. Cognitive performance was still markedly impaired post-tapering compared with normative data. Neither benzodiazepine withdrawal nor treatment group affected subjective well-being or psychosocial functioning. In conclusion, add-on melatonin does not seem to affect cognition, well-being, or psychosocial functioning in patients with severe mental illness. The observed improvement in cognitive performance could not be distinguished from retest effects, which may in turn have been facilitated by the benzodiazepine tapering.Adult Antioxidants / administration & dosage Antioxidants / pharmacology* Benzodiazepines / administration & dosage* Benzodiazepines / adverse effects Bipolar Disorder / drug therapy* Cognitive Dysfunction / chemically induced Cognitive Dysfunction / drug therapy* Double-Blind Method Female Humans Male Melatonin / administration & dosage Melatonin / pharmacology* Middle Aged Outcome Assessment, Health Care* Personal Satisfaction* Placebos Schizophrenia / drug therapy*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Current antipsychotic medications fail to satisfactorily reduce negative and cognitive symptoms and produce many unwanted side effects, necessitating the development of new compounds. Cross-species, experimental behavioural model systems can be valuable to inform the development of such drugs. The aim of the current study was to further test the hypothesis that controlled sleep deprivation is a safe and effective model system for psychosis when combined with oculomotor biomarkers of schizophrenia. Using a randomized counterbalanced within-subjects design, we investigated the effects of 1 night of total sleep deprivation in 32 healthy participants on smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM), prosaccades (PS), antisaccades (AS), and self-ratings of psychosis-like states. Compared with a normal sleep control night, sleep deprivation was associated with reduced SPEM velocity gain, higher saccadic frequency at 0.2 Hz, elevated PS spatial error, and an increase in AS direction errors. Sleep deprivation also increased intra-individual variability of SPEM, PS, and AS measures. In addition, sleep deprivation induced psychosis-like experiences mimicking hallucinations, cognitive disorganization, and negative symptoms, which in turn had moderate associations with AS direction errors. Taken together, sleep deprivation resulted in psychosis-like impairments in SPEM and AS performance. However, diverging somewhat from the schizophrenia literature, sleep deprivation additionally disrupted PS control. Sleep deprivation thus represents a promising but possibly unspecific experimental model that may be helpful to further improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms in the pathophysiology of psychosis and aid the development of antipsychotic and pro-cognitive drugs.Adult Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use* Biomarkers / metabolism Cognitive Dysfunction / drug therapy Cognitive Dysfunction / metabolism Eye Movements / drug effects Female Hallucinations / drug therapy Hallucinations / metabolism Humans Male Psychotic Disorders / drug therapy* Psychotic Disorders / metabolism Pursuit, Smooth / drug effects* Saccades / drug effects* Schizophrenia / drug therapy Schizophrenia / metabolism Sleep Deprivation / drug therapy* Sleep Deprivation / metabolism Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "The risk of neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia (TD) in older patients is known to be high, yet the course of TD in older patients has not been systematically studied. We followed 69 middle-aged and elderly outpatients newly diagnosed with TD in a naturalistic, longitudinal, prospective fashion. Standardized assessment instruments were administered to measure psychopathology, cognitive impairment, and abnormal movements. We observed a highly fluctuating early course of TD. Although the cumulative proportion of patients whose TD partially remitted was quite high (56% at 3 months, and 80% at 6 months), the cumulative proportion of patients whose TD relapsed (post-remission) was also high (33% at 3 months and 54% at 6 months). These findings may have clinical as well as theoretical implications for TD in older subjects.Aged Antipsychotic Agents / adverse effects* Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use Dyskinesia, Drug-Induced / physiopathology* Dyskinesia, Drug-Induced / psychology Female Humans Male Middle Aged Prospective Studies Schizophrenia / complications Schizophrenia / drug therapyQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "We used data from 1579 patients in a 3-year, prospective, naturalistic, nonrandomized, multisite study of schizophrenia patients conducted from July 1997 to September 2003 (U.S. Schizophrenia Care and Assessment Program). Adherence with any oral antipsychotic medication was assessed using patient-reported medication adherence and an indirect adherence measure based on medical record prescription information. Patients who reported poor medication adherence or had a medication possession ratio < or = 80% (percentage of days with prescriptions for any oral antipsychotic) during the first year after enrollment were defined as nonadherent (N = 296, 18.8%). Thirty-nine previously reported potential risk factors of nonadherence with antipsychotic medication were assessed at enrollment with valid and reliable measures. Risk factors represented patient-, environment-, and treatment-related domains, including sociodemographics, symptom severity, substance use, threat to safety of self and others, other illness-related factors, need for supervision, medication-related adverse events, and prior medication-utilization patterns.\n",
      "The best single predictor of future nonadherence was nonadherence during the 6 months prior to enrollment (odds ratio = 4.1, 95% confidence interval = 3.1 to 5.6, p < .001). The best set of predictors of nonadherence, ordered by strength of association, included prior non-adherence, recent illicit drug use, recent alcohol use, prior treatment with antidepressants, and greater patient-reported, medication-related cognitive impairment.\n",

      "This study assessed fatty acid and brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in patients with first-episode schizophrenia and related disorders. The levels of erythrocyte fatty acids and plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor were measured at baseline and week 8 after treatment with paliperidone extended release. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Cognitive Assessment Interview and the cognition subscale of the Neuroleptic-Induced Deficit Syndrome Scale. There were significant decreases in stearic acid and nervonic acid levels and a significant increase in eicosapentaenoic acid levels after eight weeks. At week 8, cognition was positively associated with dihomo-γ-linolenic acid, linoleic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid levels, and negatively associated with nervonic acid levels. Psychopathology was positively correlated with polyunsaturated fatty acid levels, and negatively correlated with saturated fatty acid levels at week 8. At both baseline and week 8, brain-derived neurotrophic factor level had a negative association with polyunsaturated fatty acids and a positive association with saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids. The present study demonstrated that fatty acids have significant associations with cognition and psychopathology at week 8, and with brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels at both baseline and week 8.Adolescent Adult Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor / blood* Cognitive Dysfunction / blood* Cognitive Dysfunction / chemically induced* Delayed-Action Preparations / adverse effects Delayed-Action Preparations / therapeutic use Fatty Acids / blood* Female Humans Male Middle Aged Paliperidone Palmitate / adverse effects* Paliperidone Palmitate / therapeutic use Schizophrenia / blood* Schizophrenia / drug therapy Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Noncompliance and poor outcome in patients with schizophrenia are closely related to the negative symptoms secondary to antipsychotics. No controlled study has evaluated whether amisulpride and aripiprazole induce negative symptoms. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of single doses of amisulpride, aripiprazole, haloperidol, and risperidone in healthy volunteers. Seventy-eight young volunteers took part in this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel study of four antipsychotics: 400 mg amisulpride, 10 mg aripiprazole, 3 mg haloperidol, and 2 mg risperidone. Assessments of negative symptoms were done 4 h after administration using both subjective rating scales (Neuroleptic Induced Deficit Syndrome Scale and Subjective Deficit Syndrome Scale) and an objective rating scale (Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms). Risperidone only produced significant increases on the avolition score of the Neuroleptic Induced Deficit Syndrome Scale and blunted affect and alogia scores of the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms compared with placebo. The effect on blunted affect persisted after controlling for mental sedation. Amisulpride, aripiprazole, and haloperidol did not induce negative symptoms. Aripiprazole and risperidone induced mild extrapyramidal symptoms. The most common adverse events were somnolence and cognitive slowing. These data indicate that a single risperidone dose induces negative symptoms in normal volunteers, whereas amisulpride, aripiprazole, and haloperidol do not. These characteristics of antipsychotics should be considered when choosing optimal drugs for patients with psychosis.Adult Amisulpride Antipsychotic Agents / administration & dosage Antipsychotic Agents / adverse effects* Aripiprazole Cognitive Dysfunction / chemically induced Dizziness / chemically induced Double-Blind Method Female Haloperidol / administration & dosage Haloperidol / adverse effects* Humans Hypnotics and Sedatives / adverse effects Male Neurotoxicity Syndromes / physiopathology* Piperazines / administration & dosage Piperazines / adverse effects* Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Quinolones / administration & dosage Quinolones / adverse effects* Risperidone / administration & dosage Risperidone / adverse effects Severity of Illness Index Sulpiride / administration & dosage Sulpiride / adverse effects Sulpiride / analogs & derivatives* Time Factors Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Previous research has suggested that high doses of conventional neuroleptics may induce neurocognitive deficits when assessed with standard tasks. However, little is known about the effects of high doses of neuroleptics (conventional or atypical) on subjective cognitive dysfunction. Recent research stresses the putative importance of self-reported cognitive deficits for both symptomatic outcome and medication compliance. The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of neuroleptic medication on subjective cognition in patients treated with either conventional or atypical agents (clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine). Patients were asked to endorse the items of a questionnaire entitled 'Subjective Well-Being under Neuroleptic Treatment' prior to discharge. Subjective impairment, as assessed with the subscale 'mental functioning', was significantly correlated with greater conventional neuroleptic dosage after controlling for psychopathology (P<0.05). The difference between patients medicated with higher doses of conventional neuroleptics and those with lower doses was highly significant (P<0.001). In contrast, higher atypical neuroleptic doses were not associated with impairment.Adult Antipsychotic Agents / administration & dosage* Antipsychotic Agents / adverse effects* Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use Benzodiazepines Clozapine / therapeutic use Cognition Disorders / chemically induced* Cognition Disorders / psychology Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Female Humans Male Olanzapine Pirenzepine / analogs & derivatives* Pirenzepine / therapeutic use Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Risperidone / therapeutic use Schizophrenia / drug therapy* Schizophrenic Psychology* Surveys and QuestionnairesQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is a measure of the influence of a stimulus (S1) on the response elicited by a second stimulus (S2) occurring shortly afterwards. Most S1/S2 measures of gating have used behavioural startle and the P50 event-related potential (ERP) amplitudes to detect PPI in a simple paired stimulus paradigm. We report on two behavioural (reaction time, RT, and the electromyographically recorded response of the musculus orbicularis oculi, EMG) and 5 ERP measures of PPI where S2 was the target in an auditory two-tone discrimination. Subjects were 21 healthy controls (CON), 11 obsessive-compulsive (OCD) and 9 schizophrenic patients (SCH). The prepulse 100 ms before S2 induced more omission errors and longer RTs compared to 500ms S1-S2 interval in all subjects. PPI was also evident in EMG, P50, N1, P3 but not P2 or N2 amplitudes of CON subjects. SCH patients showed attenuation of PPI on the same measures. OCD patients were characterized only by their slow RT and a marginal attenuation of PPI of the EMG response. A correlational analysis implied separate relationships of ERP indices of PPI to the cognitive and psychomotor consequences of the prepulse on behavioural and discrimination responses. However, SCH patients showed a general rather than a specific impairment of these indices.Acoustic Stimulation Adolescent Adult Discrimination, Psychological / physiology* Electromyography Evoked Potentials / physiology* Female Humans Male Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder / physiopathology* Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Reaction Time / physiology Reflex, Startle / physiology Schizophrenic Psychology*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",
