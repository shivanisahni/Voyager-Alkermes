      "Narcolepsy is characterised by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and cataplexy. Histamine neurons are crucial to maintain wakefulness. We assessed the safety and efficacy of pitolisant (previously called BF2.649), a selective histamine H3 receptor inverse agonist that activates these neurons, in patients with narcolepsy.\n",
      "For this double-blind, randomised, parallel-group controlled trial, we recruited patients with narcolepsy from 32 sleep disorder centres in five European countries. Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, had not taken psychostimulants for at least 14 days, and had EDS (defined as an Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS] score of at least 14). Using a computer-generated randomisation sequence, we randomly allocated patients to receive pitolisant, modafinil, or placebo (1:1:1). Treatment lasted 8 weeks: 3 weeks of flexible dosing according to investigator's judgment (10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg a day of pitolisant; 100 mg, 200 mg or 400 mg a day of modafinil) followed by 5 weeks of stable dosing. Patients took four tablets a day in a double-dummy design to ensure masking. For the primary analysis, assessed in the intention-to-treat population, we assessed the superiority of pitolisant versus placebo, and the non-inferiority of pitolisant versus modafinil. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01067222.\n",
      "Between May 26, 2009, and June 30, 2010, we screened 110 patients, 95 of whom were eligible and randomly assigned to treatment: 30 to placebo, 32 to pitolisant, and 33 to modafinil. Over the 8-week treatment period, mean ESS score reductions were -3·4 (SD 4·2) in the placebo group, -5·8 (6·2) in the pitolisant group, and -6·9 (6·2) in the modafinil group. Our primary analysis of between-group differences in mean ESS score at endpoint (adjusted for baseline) showed pitolisant to be superior to placebo (difference -3·0, 95% CI -5·6 to -0·4; p=0·024), but not non-inferior to modafinil (difference 0·12, 95% CI -2·5 to 2·7; p=0·250). We recorded 22 adverse events with pitolisant, 26 with modafinil, and ten with placebo. Six severe adverse events were treatment-related: one with pitolisant (abdominal discomfort) and five with modafinil (abdominal pain, abnormal behaviour, amphetamine-like withdrawal symptoms, lymphoadenopathy, and inner ear disorders).\n",
      "Pitolisant at doses up to 40 mg was efficacious on EDS compared with placebo and well tolerated compared with modafinil. If these findings are substantiated in further studies, pitolisant could offer a new treatment option for patients with narcolepsy.\n",

The primary endpoint was maximum effect (Emax) on the 100-point Drug Liking (\"at this moment\") visual analog scale.\n",
      "In 38 study completers (73.7% male; 65.8% white; mean age, 33.3 years), mean Drug Liking Emax was significantly greater for phentermine versus pitolisant 35.6 mg (mean difference, 21.4; p < 0.0001) and pitolisant 213.6 mg (mean difference, 19.7; p < 0.0001). Drug Liking Emax was similar for pitolisant (both doses) and placebo. Similarly, for key secondary measures of Overall Drug Liking and willingness to Take Drug Again, mean Emax scores were significantly greater for phentermine versus pitolisant (both doses) and similar for pitolisant (both doses) versus placebo. The incidence of adverse events was 82.1% after phentermine HCl 60 mg, 72.5% after pitolisant 213.6 mg, 47.5% after pitolisant 35.6 mg, and 48.8% after placebo administration.\n",

      "Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), cataplexy, direct onsets of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep from wakefulness (DREMs) and deficiency of orexins, neuropeptides that promote wakefulness largely via activation of histamine (HA) pathways. The hypothesis that the orexin defect can be circumvented by enhancing HA release was explored in narcoleptic mice and patients using tiprolisant, an inverse H(3)-receptor agonist. In narcoleptic orexin(-/-) mice, tiprolisant enhanced HA and noradrenaline neuronal activity, promoted wakefulness and decreased abnormal DREMs, all effects being amplified by co-administration of modafinil, a currently-prescribed wake-promoting drug. In a pilot single-blind trial on 22 patients receiving a placebo followed by tiprolisant, both for 1 week, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score was reduced from a baseline value of 17.6 by 1.0 with the placebo (p>0.05) and 5.9 with tiprolisant (p<0.001). Excessive daytime sleep, unaffected under placebo, was nearly suppressed on the last days of tiprolisant dosing. H(3)-receptor inverse agonists could constitute a novel effective treatment of EDS, particularly when associated with modafinil.Animals Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use Central Nervous System Stimulants / therapeutic use Disease Models, Animal Female Histamine Agonists / therapeutic use* Humans Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins / deficiency* Male Mice Mice, Inbred C57BL Mice, Knockout Modafinil Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Narcolepsy / genetics Narcolepsy / physiopathology Neuropeptides / deficiency* Orexins Piperidines / therapeutic use* Polysomnography Prospective Studies Reaction Time / drug effects Severity of Illness Index Single-Blind Method Sleep Stages / drug effects Wakefulness / drug effects*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "The histamine H3 receptor has emerged as one of the most promising targets of novel pharmacotherapy for narcolepsy. Studies now aim to investigate the optimal dose of enerisant, a novel H3 antagonist/inverse agonist, for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy.\n",
      "We conducted two phase 2, fixed-dose, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in patients with narcolepsy. The first phase 2 study (Study 1) was conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of enerisant at dosages of 25, 50, and 100 mg/day administered for 3 weeks based on the results of a phase 1 study conducted on healthy volunteers. The primary endpoint was mean sleep latency in maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT), and the secondary endpoint was the total score on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). The dosages of enerisant in the second phase 2 study (Study 2) were set at 5 and 10 mg/day based on the simulation of receptor occupancy results from positron emission tomography study.\n",
      "Forty-six and fifty-three patients were randomized in Study 1 and Study 2, respectively. The efficacy of enerisant was partially confirmed in Study 1 with ESS; however, the doses were not tolerated, and there were many withdrawals due to adverse events (mainly insomnia, headache, and nausea). The doses in Study 2 were well tolerated, with a lower incidence of adverse events in Study 2 than in Study 1, although the efficacy could not be confirmed with MWT and ESS in Study 2.\n",
      "The optimal dose of enerisant could not be determined in these two studies. Although enerisant has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, it is thought to have large interindividual variabilities in terms of efficacy and safety, suggesting the necessity of tailored dosage adjustments.\n",

      "This study was performed to evaluate the actions of baclofen and sodium oxybate, two medications with gamma-aminobutyric acid type B (GABA(B)) receptor agonist properties, on symptoms of narcolepsy in drug-naïve teenagers. Twenty-six narcoleptic teenagers with recent onset of narcolepsy-cataplexy syndrome who were human leukocyte antigen DQB1 0602 positive were matched for age and sex and received either baclofen or sodium oxybate. If deemed necessary to combat excessive daytime sleepiness, the alerting agent modafinil was also prescribed. Clinical evaluation was performed weekly, and visual analog sleepiness score and cataplexy logs were collected weekly. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale or the Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale, polysomnography, and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test were recorded at baseline and after 3 months of drug intake. The dose of baclofen demonstrating an effect on nocturnal sleep without negative side effects was determined and maintained. Both drugs increased total sleep time and delta waves during sleep, but only sodium oxybate had an effect on daytime sleepiness and cataplexy at 3 months. Improvement of total nocturnal sleep time had no beneficial effect on daytime sleepiness. The mechanism by which sodium oxybate improves cataplexy and sleepiness is inferred to be due to properties beyond direct GABA(B) agonist action.Adolescent Baclofen / administration & dosage Baclofen / therapeutic use* Benzhydryl Compounds / administration & dosage Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use Cataplexy / drug therapy Central Nervous System Stimulants / administration & dosage Central Nervous System Stimulants / therapeutic use Female Follow-Up Studies GABA Agonists / administration & dosage GABA Agonists / therapeutic use* GABA-B Receptor Agonists* Humans Male Modafinil Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Photoperiod Polysomnography Severity of Illness Index Sleep / drug effects Sodium Oxybate / administration & dosage Sodium Oxybate / therapeutic use* Time FactorsQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Pitolisant, a selective histamine 3 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist, is indicated for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness or cataplexy in adults with narcolepsy. The efficacy and safety of pitolisant have been demonstrated in randomized placebo-controlled trials. When evaluating the results of randomized placebo-controlled trials, the clinical impact of a treatment can be assessed using effect size metrics that include Cohen's d (the standardized mean difference of an effect) and number needed to treat (NNT; number of patients that need to be treated to achieve a specific outcome for one person).\n",
      "The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical impact of pitolisant for the reduction in excessive daytime sleepiness or cataplexy in adults with narcolepsy.\n",
      "This post hoc analysis incorporated data from two 7-week or 8-week randomized placebo-controlled trials (HARMONY 1, HARMONY CTP). Study medication was individually titrated, with a maximum possible pitolisant dose of 35.6 mg/day. Efficacy was assessed using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and weekly rate of cataplexy (HARMONY CTP only). Cohen's d was derived from the least-squares mean difference between treatment groups (pitolisant vs placebo), and NNTs were calculated from response rates. Treatment response was defined for excessive daytime sleepiness in two ways: (a) reduction in ESS score ≥ 3 or final ESS score ≤ 10 and (b) final ESS score ≤ 10. Treatment response was defined for cataplexy as a ≥ 25%, ≥ 50%, or ≥ 75% reduction in weekly rate of cataplexy.\n",
      "The analysis population included 61 patients in HARMONY 1 (pitolisant, n = 31; placebo, n = 30) and 105 patients in HARMONY CTP (pitolisant, n = 54; placebo, n = 51). For pitolisant vs placebo, Cohen's d effect size values were 0.61 (HARMONY 1) and 0.86 (HARMONY CTP) based on changes in ESS scores, and 0.86 (HARMONY CTP) based on changes in weekly rate of cataplexy. NNTs for pitolisant were 3-5 for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness and 3-4 for the treatment of cataplexy.\n",
      "The results of this analysis demonstrate the robust efficacy of pitolisant for the reduction in both excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. These large effect sizes and low NNTs provide further evidence supporting the strength of the clinical response to pitolisant in the treatment of adults with narcolepsy.\n",

We used a computer-generated sequence via an interactive web response system to randomly assign patients to receive either pitolisant or placebo once per day (1:1 ratio). Randomisation was done in blocks of four. Participants and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. Treatment lasted for 7 weeks: 3 weeks of flexible dosing decided by investigators according to efficacy and tolerance (5 mg, 10 mg, or 20 mg oral pitolisant), followed by 4 weeks of stable dosing (5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg). The primary endpoint was the change in the average number of cataplexy attacks per week as recorded in patient diaries (weekly cataplexy rate [WCR]) between the 2 weeks of baseline and the 4 weeks of stable dosing period.

      "We studied the effects of modafinil, a putative central alpha-1 agonist, on the excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) of 10 narcoleptic patients while using a double-blind design and objective measurements of vigilance. There were two treatment periods, in which either modafinil or placebo was used; each lasted four weeks and was preceded by a 2-week \"run-in\" period and separated by a 2-week \"wash-out\" period. The effects of treatment on EDS were evaluated by daily home questionnaires and a psychomotor performance test, the Four Choice Reaction Time Test (FCRTT). Modafinil reduced the daily number of sleep attacks significantly, and markedly improved performances during the FCRTT. Results of this study suggest that modafinil is effective in treating EDS in narcolepsy, and that noradrenergic mechanisms could be involved in the physiopathology of EDS in that disorder.Adult Analysis of Variance Arousal / drug effects Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use* Blood Pressure / drug effects Body Temperature / drug effects Central Nervous System Stimulants / therapeutic use* Double-Blind Method Female Heart Rate / drug effects Humans Male Middle Aged Modafinil Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Polysomnography Psychomotor Performance / drug effects Reaction Time / drug effects Sleep / drug effectsQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is an endogenous GHB-/GABA-B receptor agonist and a narcolepsy treatment. However, GHB is also abused for its prohedonic effects. On a neuronal level, it was shown that GHB increases regional cerebral blood flow in limbic areas such as the right anterior insula (rAI) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). We aimed to further explore the association between the subjective and neuronal signatures of GHB.\n",
      "We assessed subjective effects and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of an rAI- and an ACC-seed in 19 healthy male subjects after GHB (35 mg/kg p.o.) using a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, cross-over functional magnet resonance imaging design.\n",
      "GHB increased subjective ratings for euphoria (p < 0.001) and sexual arousal (p < 0.01). Moreover, GHB increased rAI-rsFC to the right thalamus and the superior frontal gyrus and decreased ACC-rsFC to the bilateral paracentral lobule (all p < 0.05, cluster corrected). Moreover, GHB-induced euphoria was associated with rAI-rsFC to the superior frontal gyrus (p < 0.05, uncorrected).\n",
      "GHB induces prohedonic effects such as euphoria and sexual arousal and in parallel modulates limbic rsFC with areas linked to regulation of mood, cognitive control, and sexual experience. These results further elucidate the drug's effects in neuropsychiatric disorders and as drug of abuse.Adult Cerebral Cortex / diagnostic imaging Cerebral Cortex / drug effects* Cerebral Cortex / physiology Connectome / methods* Cross-Over Studies Double-Blind Method Euphoria / drug effects* GABA-B Receptor Agonists / administration & dosage GABA-B Receptor Agonists / pharmacology* Gyrus Cinguli / diagnostic imaging Gyrus Cinguli / drug effects Gyrus Cinguli / physiology Humans Libido / drug effects* Limbic System / diagnostic imaging Limbic System / drug effects* Limbic System / physiology Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Sodium Oxybate / administration & dosage Sodium Oxybate / pharmacology* Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "γ-Hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is used as a treatment for narcolepsy and alcohol withdrawal and as a recreational substance. Nevertheless, there are limited data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships of GHB in humans. We characterized the pharmacokinetic profile and exposure-psychotropic effect relationship of GHB in humans.\n",
      "Two oral doses of GHB (25 and 35 mg kg(-1) ) were administered to 32 healthy male subjects (16 for each dose) using a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over design.\n",
      "Maximal concentrations of GHB were (geometric mean and 95% CI): 218 (176-270) nmol ml(-1) and 453 (374-549) nmol ml(-1) for the 25 and 35 mg kg(-1) GHB doses, respectively. The elimination half-lives (mean ± SD) were 36 ± 9 and 39 ± 7 min and the AUC∞ values (geometric mean and 95% CI) were 15 747 (12 854-19 290) and 40 113 (33 093-48 622) nmol∙min ml(-1) for the 20 and 35 mg kg(-1) GHB doses, respectively. Thus, plasma GHB exposure (AUC0-∞ ) rose disproportionally (+40%) with the higher dose. γ-Hydroxybutyrate produced mixed stimulant-sedative effects, with a dose-dependent increase in sedation and dizziness. It did not alter heart rate or blood pressure. A close relationship between plasma GHB exposure and its psychotropic effects was found, with higher GHB concentrations associated with higher subjective stimulation, sedation, and dizziness. No clockwise hysteresis was observed in the GHB concentration effect plot over time (i.e., no acute pharmacological tolerance).\n",
      "Evidence was found of a nonlinear dose-exposure relationship (i.e., no dose proportionality) at moderate doses of GHB. The effects of GHB on consciousness were closely linked to its plasma exposure and exhibited no acute tolerance.Administration, Oral Adult Blood Pressure / drug effects Cross-Over Studies Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Drug Tolerance GABA Agonists / administration & dosage GABA Agonists / pharmacokinetics GABA Agonists / pharmacology* Healthy Volunteers Heart Rate / drug effects Humans Hypnotics and Sedatives / administration & dosage Hypnotics and Sedatives / pharmacokinetics Hypnotics and Sedatives / pharmacology* Male Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Psychotropic Drugs / administration & dosage Psychotropic Drugs / pharmacokinetics Psychotropic Drugs / pharmacology* Sodium Oxybate / administration & dosage Sodium Oxybate / pharmacokinetics Sodium Oxybate / pharmacology* Substance Withdrawal Syndrome / drug therapy* Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Bromocriptine, a preferential D2 receptor agonist, was administered to six human narcoleptic patients during a double-blind, cross-over study. Laboratory sessions consisted of two all-night polysomnographic recordings and three daytime tests of vigilance: the Analogue Vigilance Scale (AVS), the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT), and the Four-Choice Reaction Time Test (FCRTT). No change in nocturnal sleep organization, daytime somnolence, or psychomotor performance was observed during bromocriptine administration. Periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS) were significantly reduced during bromocriptine condition. These results suggest that D2 receptors are unlikely to play a major role in the physiopathology of human narcolepsy, and support the hypothesis that dopaminergic mechanisms are involved in PLMS.Adult Arousal / drug effects Bromocriptine / therapeutic use* Double-Blind Method Female Humans Male Middle Aged Movement / drug effects Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Narcolepsy / psychology Psychomotor Performance / drug effects Sleep / drug effectsQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB; or sodium oxybate) is an endogenous GHB-/gamma-aminobutyric acid B receptor agonist. It is approved for application in narcolepsy and has been proposed for the potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, fibromyalgia, and depression, all of which involve neuro-immunological processes. Tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs), the cortisol-awakening response (CAR), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have been suggested as peripheral biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. GHB has been shown to induce a delayed reduction of T helper and natural killer cell counts and alter basal cortisol levels, but GHB's effects on TRYCATs, CAR, and BDNF are unknown.\n",
      "Therefore, TRYCAT and BDNF serum levels, as well as CAR and the affective state (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule [PANAS]) were measured in the morning after a single nocturnal dose of GHB (50 mg/kg body weight) in 20 healthy male volunteers in a placebo-controlled, balanced, randomized, double-blind, cross-over design.\n",
      "In the morning after nocturnal GHB administration, the TRYCATs indolelactic acid, kynurenine, kynurenic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine, and quinolinic acid; the 3-hydroxykynurenine to kynurenic acid ratio; and the CAR were significantly reduced (P < 0.05-0.001, Benjamini-Hochberg corrected). The quinolinic acid to kynurenic acid ratio was reduced by trend. Serotonin, tryptophan, and BDNF levels, as well as PANAS scores in the morning, remained unchanged after a nocturnal GHB challenge.\n",
      "GHB has post-acute effects on peripheral biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders, which might be a model to explain some of its therapeutic effects in disorders involving neuro-immunological pathologies.

      "Narcolepsy is a life-long disorder characterised by excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy, often arising in childhood or adolescence. Pitolisant, a selective histamine H3 receptor inverse agonist, has been approved in Europe and USA for adults with narcolepsy with or without cataplexy, with a favourable safety profile. This phase 3 study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of pitolisant in children with narcolepsy with or without cataplexy.\n",
      "For this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multisite study, we recruited patients aged 6-17 years with narcolepsy with or without cataplexy in 11 sleep centres in five countries (Italy, France, Netherlands, Russia, and Finland). Participants were required to have a Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale score of 15 or greater and to have not received psychostimulants for at least 14 days before enrolment; participants who needed anticataplectics (including sodium oxybate) were required to have been on a stable dose for at least 1 month. Participants were randomly assigned to treatment with pitolisant or placebo in a 2:1 ratio at the end of screening. Randomisation was stratified by study centre and treatment was allocated using an interactive web response system. After a 4-week screening period including a 2-week baseline period, patients entered in a 4-week individual up-titration scheme from 5 mg a day to a maximum of 40 mg a day of pitolisant or placebo; treatment was administered at a stable dose for 4 weeks, followed by a 1-week placebo period. For the primary analysis, we assessed pitolisant versus placebo using change in the Ullanlinna Narcolepsy Scale (UNS) total score from baseline to the end of double-blind period in the full analysis set, defined as all randomly allocated patients who received at least one dose of treatment and who had at least one baseline UNS value. A decrease in the UNS total score reflects a reduction in both excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. All adverse events were assessed in the safety population, defined as all participants who took at least one dose of study medication. An open-label follow-up is ongoing. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02611687.\n",
      "Between June 6, 2016, and April 3, 2021, we screened 115 participants and 110 were randomly assigned (mean age 12·9 [SD 3·0] years, 61 [55%] male, and 90 [82%] with cataplexy; 72 assigned to pitolisant and 38 to placebo); 107 (70 receiving pitolisant and 37 receiving placebo) completed the double-blind period. The mean adjusted difference in UNS total score from baseline to the end of the double-blind period was -6·3 (SE 1·1) in the pitolisant group and -2·6 (1·4) in the placebo group (least squares mean difference -3·7; 95% CI -6·4 to -1·0, p=0·007). Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 22 (31%) of 72 patients in the pitolisant group and 13 (34%) of 38 patients in the placebo group. The most frequently reported adverse events (affecting ≥5% of patients) in either group were headache (14 [19%] in the pitolisant group and three [8%] in the placebo group) and insomnia (five [7%] in the pitolisant group and one [3%] in the placebo group).\n",
      "Pitolisant treatment resulted in an improvement in narcolepsy symptoms in children, although the UNS was not validated for use in children with narcolepsy when our study began. The safety profile was similar to that reported in adults but further studies are needed to confirm long-term safety.\n",

      "Sodium oxybate (SO) is a GABAβ agonist used to treat the sleep disorder narcolepsy. SO was shown to increase slow wave sleep (SWS) and EEG delta power (0.75-4.5 Hz), both indexes of NREM sleep (NREMS) intensity and depth, suggesting that SO enhances recuperative function of NREM. We investigated whether SO induces physiological deep sleep.\n",
      "SO was administered before an afternoon nap or before the subsequent experimental night in 13 healthy volunteers. The effects of SO were compared to baclofen (BAC), another GABAβ receptor agonist, to assess the role of GABAβ receptors in the SO response.\n",
      "As expected, a nap significantly decreased sleep need and intensity the subsequent night. Both drugs reversed this nap effect on the subsequent night by decreasing sleep latency and increasing total sleep time, SWS during the first NREMS episode, and EEG delta and theta (0.75-7.25 Hz) power during NREMS. The SO-induced increase in EEG delta and theta power was, however, not specific to NREMS and was also observed during REM sleep (REMS) and wakefulness. Moreover, the high levels of delta power during a nap following SO administration did not affect delta power the following night. SO and BAC taken before the nap did not improve subsequent psychomotor performance and subjective alertness, or memory consolidation. Finally, SO and BAC strongly promoted the appearance of sleep onset REM periods.\n",
      "The SO-induced EEG slow waves seem not to be functionally similar to physiological slow waves.

      "Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is a GHB-/GABA-B receptor agonist inducing a broad spectrum of subjective effects including euphoria, disinhibition, and enhanced vitality. It is used as treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders including narcolepsy and alcohol withdrawal, but is also a drug of abuse. Non-medical users report enhancement of body and emotion awareness during intoxication. However, the neuronal underpinnings of such awareness alterations under GHB are unknown so far. The assessment of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) by pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) enables the elucidation of drug-induced functional brain alterations. Thus, we assessed the effects of GHB (35 mg/kg p.o.) in 17 healthy males on rCBF and subjective drug effects, using a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, cross-over design employing arterial spin labeling phMRI. Compared to placebo, GHB increased subjective ratings for body and emotion awareness, and for dizziness (p<0.01-0.001, Bonferroni-corrected). A whole-brain analysis showed increased rCBF in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the right anterior insula under GHB (p<0.05, cluster-corrected). ACC and insula rCBF are correlated with relaxation, and body and emotion awareness (p<0.05-0.001, uncorrected). Interaction analyses revealed that GHB-induced increase of body awareness was accompanied by increased rCBF in ACC, whereas relaxation under GHB was accompanied by elevated rCBF in right anterior insula (p<0.05, uncorrected). In conclusion, enhancement of emotion and body awareness, and increased perfusion of insula and ACC bears implications both for the properties of GHB as a drug of abuse as well as for its putative personalized potential for specific therapeutic indications in affective disorders.Adult Analysis of Variance Anesthetics, Intravenous / pharmacology* Awareness / drug effects* Cerebrovascular Circulation / drug effects* Cross-Over Studies Double-Blind Method Emotions / drug effects* Female Humans Image Processing, Computer-Assisted Limbic System / diagnostic imaging Limbic System / drug effects* Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Oxygen / blood Rest Sodium Oxybate / pharmacology* Whole Body Imaging Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Pramipexole is a non-ergot dopamine agonist used to treat Parkinson's disease (PD). Because of concern regarding driving safety, we evaluated the incidence and nature of somnolence experienced by patients receiving pramipexole in clinical trials at our center. A retrospective chart review was performed and structured interviews were conducted with patients who had reported moderate or severe somnolence. In addition, two patients underwent polysomnography (PSG) and multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT) while on and 2 weeks after discontinuation of pramipexole. Forty patients with PD participating in pramipexole clinical trials were identified. In the double-blind phases of the studies, 22 patients were randomized to pramipexole and 18 were randomized to placebo. Six patients assigned to pramipexole reported somnolence as an adverse event (1 moderate, 5 mild) compared with two patients assigned to placebo (1 severe, 1 moderate; p = 0.19, one-tailed Fisher's exact test). Thirty-seven patients participated in open-label extension studies. Twenty-one (57%) reported somnolence as an adverse event. Eleven (30%) patients reported moderate somnolence and three (8%) patients reported severe somnolence. For patients with moderate or severe somnolence, the onset of worst-reported somnolence occurred at a mean (+/- standard error) pramipexole dose of 4.0 +/- 0.4 mg (range, 0.75-4.5 mg) per day. Patients had been taking pramipexole for a total of 10.0 +/- 1.5 months (range, .03-22 mos) and at their maximal dose for 6.7 +/- 1.5 months (range, .03-20 mos). During structured interviews with 12 of the 14 patients reporting moderate or severe somnolence, seven reported falling asleep while driving and two reported minor motor vehicle accidents caused by falling asleep. Most patients reported relatively continuous drowsiness that led to falling asleep without acute warning during periods of inactivity. Three patients reported discreet waves of irresistible sleepiness heralded by prodromal symptoms occurring against a background of normal wakefulness. MSLT in two of these patients revealed decreased latency to sleep without early onset of rapid eye movements. Sleep latency normalized after withdrawal of pramipexole. Intensive patient education is necessary to prevent motor vehicle accidents in patients taking pramipexole. We recommend that patients who are experiencing generalized drowsiness and falling asleep during periods of inactivity be instructed not to drive because these patients do fall asleep without acute warning. Somnolence usually resolves with pramipexole dose reduction or discontinuation. Patients should also be alerted to pull over and stop driving immediately if they feel a wave of sleepiness coming on. Patient education and compliance are critical to maximize safety.Aged Antiparkinson Agents / adverse effects* Antiparkinson Agents / therapeutic use Automobile Driving Benzothiazoles Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Double-Blind Method Female Humans Levodopa / adverse effects Levodopa / therapeutic use Male Middle Aged Narcolepsy / chemically induced* Narcolepsy / diagnosis Parkinson Disease / drug therapy* Polysomnography Pramipexole Retrospective Studies Thiazoles / adverse effects* Thiazoles / therapeutic useQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "The dual orexin receptor antagonist daridorexant, studied in two phase III trials, dose-dependently improved objective and subjective sleep variables and daytime functioning in adults with insomnia. Because treatment of insomnia in older adults is challenging and has limited options, the purpose of the current analysis was to further analyse the phase III trial studying the higher doses of daridorexant, those that showed efficacy (daridorexant 50 mg, daridorexant 25 mg and placebo, nightly for 3 months), and compare the safety and efficacy of daridorexant in patients aged ≥ 65 ('older adults') to those aged < 65 years ('younger adults').\n",
      "Analyses by age (≥ 65 years, n = 364; < 65 years, n = 566) were performed on data from the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Trial 1 in adult patients with insomnia (NCT03545191). Efficacy endpoints included a change from baseline at month 1 and month 3 in polysomnography-measured wake after sleep onset (WASO) and latency to persistent sleep (LPS), self-reported total sleep time (sTST) and daytime functioning assessed using the validated Insomnia Daytime Symptoms and Impacts Questionnaire (IDSIQ). Safety endpoints included adverse events and the Visual Analog Scale for morning sleepiness.\n",
      "At baseline, mean [standard deviation] WASO was numerically greater (110 [39] vs 92 [38] min) in older than younger adults, while LPS was comparable (~ 65 min). Mean baseline IDSIQ total and all domain scores were numerically lower (i.e. better) in older adults. Daridorexant caused similar reductions in WASO and LPS, and similar increases in sTST, from baseline, in both age groups; improvements were numerically greater with daridorexant 50 mg than 25 mg. At month 3, daridorexant 50 mg, compared with placebo, decreased WASO by a least-squares mean of 19.6 (95% confidence interval 9.7, 29.5) in older patients versus 17.4 min (10.7, 24.0) in younger patients and decreased LPS by a least-squares mean of 14.9 (7.5, 22.3) in older patients versus 9.7 min (3.7, 15.7) in younger patients. Daridorexant 50 mg increased sTST from baseline to month 3 by a least-squares mean of 59.9 (49.6, 70.3) in older patients versus 57.1 min (48.9, 65.3) in younger patients. Daridorexant 50 mg progressively improved IDSIQ total and domain scores from week 1 onwards similarly in both groups; daridorexant 25 mg improved IDSIQ scores, but only in younger adults. In both age groups, in comparison with placebo, the overall incidence of adverse events was comparable, and there were fewer falls on daridorexant. Daridorexant improved Visual Analog Scale morning sleepiness in both groups; daridorexant 50 mg increased the mean (standard deviation) Visual Analog Scale morning sleepiness score by 15.9 (20.7) in older adults and by 14.9 (18.7) in younger adults from baseline to month 3. In older adults, there was one case of sleep paralysis, and no cases of narcolepsy, cataplexy, or complex sleep behaviour.\n",
      "In older patients with insomnia, as in younger patients, the efficacy of daridorexant is maximal on night-time and daytime variables at the higher dose of 50 mg. Older patients particularly require this dose to improve daytime functioning. Older patients are not at an increased risk of adverse events or residual effects the next morning after night-time administration of daridorexant, even at 50 mg. The dose of daridorexant does not need to be decreased for older patients.\n",
      "ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03545191) [first posted: 4 June, 4 2018], https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03545191 .\n",
      "The burden of chronic insomnia (difficulty in falling/staying asleep or not getting enough sleep) increases with age yet treatment options in older patients are limited. In older patients, because of a risk of side effects, guidelines suggest caution when prescribing sleep medications and, for some drugs, recommend starting at a lower dose. Daridorexant was approved in 2022 for the treatment of insomnia in adults following positive results in two trials that showed daridorexant significantly improved night-time sleep and daytime functioning over 3 months of treatment in adults with insomnia. Approximately 40% of patients taking part in these trials were aged 65 years or older. This current analysis compared the safety and benefits of daridorexant in older adults (aged at least 65 years) and younger adults (aged less than 65 years) in the trial that administered the highest two doses of daridorexant, 25 and 50 mg. The results showed that the benefits of daridorexant were comparable in both age groups over 3 months; compared with placebo, daridorexant improved night-time sleep (reduced time awake during the night, reduced time to fall asleep and increased total sleep time) and daytime functioning—patients had less daytime sleepiness and a better mood and feeling of alertness. In older patients, the benefits, particularly for daytime functioning, were greatest at the higher 50-mg dose, without any increase in side effects. Both doses of daridorexant were equally well tolerated in the two age groups, indicating that treatment with daridorexant at 50 mg can be safely started in older patients.Aged Double-Blind Method Humans Imidazoles Lipopolysaccharides Orexin Receptor Antagonists / adverse effects Pyrrolidines Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders* / drug therapy Sleepiness Treatment OutcomeQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "A recent study in narcolepsy patients has shown that ritanserin, a 5HT2-antagonist, reduced wake after sleep onset times and subjective sleepiness during daytime. To assess the efficacy of this compound in a statistically sufficient number of narcoleptic patients a double-blind, placebo-controlled, European multi-center study on the effects of ritanserin on daytime sleepiness, the feeling of being refreshed in the morning, number of unwanted sleep periods and slow-wave sleep was performed. All 134 narcolepsy patients were allowed to remain on stable concomitant antidepressant, stimulant and gammahydroxybutyrate medication during the trial. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with 5 mg or 10 mg ritanserin or placebo given once daily for 28 days. Efficacy was measured by two 40-hour polysomnographic recordings, visual analogue scales and physician, partner, parents and patient-rated sleep-wake behavior tests prior to and after the trial. Patients kept diaries on sleepiness, numbers of wanted and unwanted sleep periods, feeling of being refreshed and frequency of narcoleptic symptoms during the entire treatment period. Treatment with 5 and 10 mg ritanserin significantly improved the 'feeling of being refreshed in the morning,' but no other narcoleptic symptoms as assessed in the diary. Whereas investigators had the impression that the primary efficacy parameters were not improved by ritanserin, patients reported significant improvements in four out of six parameters, and patients partners in two out of six parameters with 5 mg ritanserin compared to placebo. Both ritanserin doses resulted in a significant increase of nocturnal slow-wave sleep (percentage of total sleep time) and a significant, dose-dependent reduction in NREM stage 1 percentage during daytime sleep. The significant polysomnographic findings were not paralleled by changes in the subjective parameters daytime sleepiness or number of unplanned sleep periods. In contrast to the first study on narcoleptic patients, ritanserin only improved one subjective parameter, but did not improve objective sleep quality or number of \"sleep attacks\" or reduce \"wake after sleep onset\" during night or daytime sleep. In conclusion, ritanserin may serve as add-on medication for the treatment of impaired sleep quality in narcoleptic patients, but not as a stimulant or hypnotic type of medication.Adult Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Double-Blind Method Drug Therapy, Combination Female Humans Male Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Polysomnography Ritanserin / administration & dosage Ritanserin / therapeutic use* Serotonin Antagonists / administration & dosage Serotonin Antagonists / therapeutic use* Sleep / drug effectsQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Suvorexant is a pharmacologically novel dual antagonist of orexin receptors OX1R and OX2R, which has an effect that promotes sleep by reducing arousal and wakefulness. Its approval for the treatment of insomnia was based on three clinical trials that found it to be efficacious and relatively well tolerated. Somnolence, headache, and dry mouth are the most common side effects. Because suvorexant has unique effects on arousal systems and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, it is contraindicated in patients with narcolepsy, and its use should be avoided or closely monitored in patients at risk for REM sleep behavior disorder, depression, or delirium.Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Azepines / therapeutic use* Female Humans Male Middle Aged Orexin Receptor Antagonists* Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders / drug therapy* Triazoles / therapeutic use*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Some central hypersomnolence syndromes are associated with a positive allosteric modulator of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A receptors in cerebrospinal fluid. Negative allosteric modulators of GABA-A receptors, including clarithromycin, have been reported to reduce sleepiness in these patients. We sought to systematically assess the effects of clarithromycin on objective vigilance and subjective sleepiness.\n",
      "This was a 5-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial of clarithromycin 500mg with breakfast and lunch, in patients with hypersomnolence syndromes (excluding narcolepsy with cataplexy) and evidence for abnormal cerebrospinal fluid potentiation of GABA-A receptors. The study occurred at a university-affiliated medical center. The primary outcome measure was median reaction time on the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) at week 2 in each condition. Secondary outcomes included the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Stanford Sleepiness Scale, Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, SF-36, and additional PVT measures.\n",
      "Twenty-three patients began treatment. Three patients dropped out, and final analyses were performed on 20 complete cases. Median reaction time was not significantly different between clarithromycin and placebo. Subjective measures of sleepiness were significantly improved on clarithromycin versus placebo. Altered taste perception occurred, but was the only side effect more common on clarithromycin than placebo. No serious adverse events occurred.\n",
      "Subjective sleepiness, but not psychomotor vigilance, improved during a 2-week course of clarithromycin. Although additional studies are needed, this suggests that clarithromycin may be a reasonable treatment option in patients with treatment-refractory hypersomnolence.

      "Decreased serotonergic facilitation of upper-airway motor neurons during sleep has been postulated as an important mechanism rendering the upper airway vulnerable to obstruction in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA). Although serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been shown to produce modest reductions in the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, they have not been proven to be generally effective as treatments for OSA. Conversely, antagonists of type 3 (5-HT3) serotonin receptors effectively have been shown to reduce the frequency of central apneas during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in a rodent model of sleep-related breathing disorder. We sought to determine whether mirtazapine, a mixed 5-HT2/5-HT3 antagonist that also promotes serotonin release in the brain would effectively reduce AHI during both NREM and REM sleep in patients with OSA.\n",
      "A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-way crossover study of mirtazapine in patients with OSA.\n",
      "Laboratory studies were conducted in the Center for Sleep and Ventilatory Disorders at the University of Illinois Medical Center.\n",
      "Seven adult men and 5 adult women with newly diagnosed (treatment-naïve) and medically uncomplicated OSA were randomized into the study.\n",
      "Each subject self-administered oral medications 30 minutes before bedtime each night for 3 consecutive 7-day treatment periods. These treatments comprised (1) placebo, (2) 4.5 mg per day of mirtazapine, and (3) 15 mg per day of mirtazapine. The order of treatments was randomized for each subject, and orders were counterbalanced for the overall study.\n",
      "Each subject charted his or her sleep-wake schedule throughout the study and completed the Stanford Sleepiness Scale every 2 hours during the seventh day of each treatment period. Subjects were studied by laboratory polysomnography on the seventh night of each treatment period. With respect to placebo treatment, 4.5 mg of mirtazapine significantly reduced the AHI in all sleep stages to 52%, with 11 of 12 subjects showing improvement over placebo; 15 mg of mirtazapine reduced the AHI to 46%, with 12 of 12 subjects showing improvement over placebo. Sleep fragmentation was reduced only by the higher dose of mirtazapine. Gross changes in sleep architecture were unremarkable.\n",
      "Daily administration of 4.5 to 15 mg of mirtazapine for 1 week reduces AHI by half in adult patients with OSA. This represents the largest and most consistent drug-treatment effect demonstrated to date in a controlled trial. These findings suggest the therapeutic potential of mixed-profile serotonergic drugs in OSA and provide support for future studies with related formulations. Mirtazapine also is associated with sedation and weight gain-2 negative side effects in patients with OSA.

      "Arousal is regulated by the interplay between wakefulness- and sleep-promoting nuclei. Major wakefulness-promoting nuclei are the histaminergic tuberomamillary nucleus (TMN) of the hypothalamus and the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) of the pons, which also play a role in autonomic regulation. First generation antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, are likely to cause sedation by blocking excitatory H1 histamine receptors in the cerebral cortex, and the anti-narcolepsy drug modafinil may promote wakefulness by activating the locus coeruleus. We compared the effects of single doses of diphenhydramine (75 mg) and modafinil (200 mg) on arousal and autonomic functions in 16 healthy male volunteers, using a placebo-controlled, balanced, double-blind design. Arousal was assessed by critical flicker fusion frequency (CFFF), visual analogue scales (VAS) and pupillary fatigue waves (Pupillographic Sleepiness Test (PST)). Autonomic functions measured included resting pupil diameter, light and darkness reflex responses, blood pressure, heart rate and salivation. Data were analysed with ANOVA, with multiple comparisons. Diphenhydramine had sedative effects as shown by reductions in CFFF, VAS alertness ratings and increases of the indices of pupillary fatigue. Modafinil had alerting effects as indicated by reductions in the measures of pupillary fatigue. Comparison of pre-post medication changes in pupil diameter showed a decrease after diphenhydramine and an increase after modafinil. Diphenhydramine reduced salivation, and modafinil increased systolic blood pressure. In conclusion, diphenhydramine and modafinil evoked opposite effects on arousal and sympathetic functions, which are likely to reflect their interaction with the central histaminergic and noradrenergic systems. Hyposalivation by diphenhydramine is likely to be due to its additional anticholinergic property.Administration, Oral Adult Affect / drug effects Arousal / drug effects* Attention / drug effects Autonomic Nervous System / drug effects* Benzhydryl Compounds / administration & dosage Benzhydryl Compounds / pharmacology* Blood Pressure / drug effects Central Nervous System Stimulants / administration & dosage Central Nervous System Stimulants / pharmacology* Cross-Over Studies Diphenhydramine / administration & dosage Diphenhydramine / pharmacology* Double-Blind Method Flicker Fusion / drug effects Histamine H1 Antagonists / administration & dosage Histamine H1 Antagonists / pharmacology* Humans Male Modafinil Reference Values Reflex, Pupillary / drug effects Salivation / drug effectsQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "We treated 17 narcolepsy patients in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial with 10-, 20-, 30-, and 40-mg daily doses of selegiline, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor widely used in Parkinson's disease. There was a dose-dependent as well as a statistically and clinically significant improvement in narcoleptic symptoms and polygraphic measures. At 40 mg, there was a 36% reduction in the number of daytime sleep episodes and a 34% reduction in their duration (compared with placebo, mean values). The number of excessive sleepiness episodes decreased by 43%, and the duration decreased by 47%. The number of cataplectic attacks was reduced by 89%. On the multiple sleep latency test, the REM sleep latency increased from 5.0 to 13.3 minutes, and the number of sleep-onset REM periods decreased from 3.1 to 0.6. Sleep (S1) latency was not changed. No intolerable adverse events occurred. The effective dose range was 20 to 40 mg, requiring a low-tyramine diet, which was easy to maintain. In conclusion, selegiline alleviates both main symptoms of narcolepsy--the abnormal sleep tendency and cataplexy. Thus, treatment with selegiline makes it possible to avoid polypharmacy and to use a potent stimulant without known addiction risk.Adolescent Adult Aged Cross-Over Studies Double-Blind Method Female Humans Male Middle Aged Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Placebos Selegiline / therapeutic use*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "A randomized, double-blind cross-over trial was carried out in 10 patients with narcolepsy to evaluate the effect of 600 mg femoxetine versus placebo. In comparison to placebo, femoxetine treatment resulted in a significant decrease in both the number and severity score of cataplectic attacks per day. There were also significantly fewer attacks of sleep paralysis, whilst the effects on nightmare and hypnogenic hallucinations were minor. The frequency of sleep attacks decreased slightly during femoxetine treatment, but the overall estimated sleep time during the day and excessive daytime sleepiness remained un-affected. An ambulatory sleep recording for 48 h one week after the start of the femoxetine and placebo period showed that femoxetine treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the total time spent in REM sleep. The side-effects of femoxetine were restricted to transient nausea in 2 patients. It is concluded that femoxetine or other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be a useful alternative for narcoleptic patients who experience troublesome side-effects with tricyclic antidepressants.Adult Aged Clinical Trials as Topic Double-Blind Method Female Humans Male Middle Aged Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Narcolepsy / physiopathology Nausea / chemically induced Piperidines / adverse effects Piperidines / pharmacology Piperidines / therapeutic use* Sleep Stages / drug effectsQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Solriamfetol (JZP-110), a selective dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with robust wake-promoting effects, is currently being evaluated for the reduction of sleepiness and improvement of wakefulness in patients with narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and bioavailability of solriamfetol at the highest intended therapeutic dose in healthy adults and to characterize its renal excretion under fasting conditions.\n",
      "In this open-label, randomized, crossover study, healthy adult subjects received a single 300-mg dose of solriamfetol in a fasted condition (10 h) and in a fed condition (30 min after the start of a standardized high-fat, high-calorie breakfast), with at least a 7-day washout period between doses. Blood samples for PK analyses were collected during both conditions at prespecified time points. Urine samples were collected up to 48 h postdose in the fasted condition. Samples were analyzed for solriamfetol (plasma and urine) and N-acetyl solriamfetol (urine) by using validated LC-MS/MS bioanalytical methods. The effect of food on solriamfetol relative bioavailability was examined by comparing the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the fed/fasted ratios of natural log-transformed PK parameters C\n",
      "A total of 32 subjects were enrolled (50% female; 53.1% black, 46.9% white; mean age, 35.6 years), and 31 were included in the PK analyses. Solriamfetol was rapidly absorbed in both conditions. The 90% CIs for the fed/fasted geometric mean ratios were 89.2-98.8 for C\n",
      "Solriamfetol relative bioavailability was bioequivalent in the fed and fasted conditions, showing that solriamfetol can be taken without regard to meals; furthermore, tolerability was similar in both conditions.

      "A double-blind, placebo-controlled sodium oxybate trial provided a unique opportunity to compare changes in cataplexy following gradual withdrawal from antidepressants in narcolepsy patients.\n",
      "Of 228 enrolled patients, 71 discontinued antidepressant therapy. Data from 57 patients were available for analysis: 37 patients discontinued tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and 20 discontinued selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The trial included a 21-day withdrawal phase followed by 18-day washout and 14-day single-blind treatment phases. Two additional weeks were permitted for withdrawal from fluoxetine due to its long half-life. Weekly cataplexy attacks were recorded throughout the trial. No historical data on the frequency of cataplexy prior to treatment with antidepressants was available.\n",
      "Among the patients who were and were not withdrawn from antidepressants treatment, the median frequency of baseline weekly cataplexy was similar (17.5 vs. 14.0, respectively). As expected, significant between-group differences emerged by the end of the washout period (52.04 vs. 15.25, respectively; p<0.05); however, the frequency of cataplexy events became similar again by the end of the trial (16.5 vs. 17.5, respectively).\n",
      "Patients gradually withdrawn from antidepressants experienced a significant increase in cataplexy, but eventually returned to their baseline frequency, comparable to previously untreated control patients. Compared to SSRIs, discontinuation from TCAs was associated with a greater increase in cataplexy attacks.Adult Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic / administration & dosage Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic / adverse effects* Cataplexy / chemically induced* Cataplexy / diagnosis Cataplexy / epidemiology* Cohort Studies Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Humans Narcolepsy / drug therapy Retrospective Studies Risk Factors Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors / administration & dosage Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors / adverse effects* Sodium Oxybate / therapeutic use Substance Withdrawal Syndrome / diagnosis Substance Withdrawal Syndrome / epidemiology*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Hypocretins, excitatory neuropeptides at monoaminergic synapses, appear to regulate human sleep-wake cycles. Undetectable cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels are seen in narcolepsy, which is frequently associated with secondary depression. Shortened rapid eye movement latency is observed in both narcolepsy and depression. Cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels have not been reported in mood disorders.\n",
      "We examined hypocretin-1 levels in 14 control and 15 depressed subjects. Cerebrospinal fluid was drawn continuously in supine subjects for 24 hours with an indwelling intrathecal catheter under entrained light-dark conditions. Depressed subjects were studied before and after 5 weeks of sertraline (n=10, three nonresponders) or bupropion (n=5, two nonresponders).\n",
      "Hypocretin-1 levels varied slightly (amplitude 10%) but significantly across the diurnal cycle in control subjects, with amplitude significantly reduced in depression (3%). Levels were lowest at midday, surprising for a hypothetically wake-promoting peptide. Mean hypocretin levels trended higher in depressive than in control subjects. Hypocretin-1 levels decreased modestly but significantly after sertraline (-14%) but not bupropion.\n",
      "Our results are consistent with previous physiologic findings in depression indicating dampened diurnal variations in hypocretin-1. The finding that sertraline but not bupropion slightly decreased cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 indicates a serotoninergic influence on hypocretin tone.Adult Antidepressive Agents / therapeutic use Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation / therapeutic use Bupropion / therapeutic use Carrier Proteins / cerebrospinal fluid* Carrier Proteins / drug effects Case-Control Studies Circadian Rhythm* / drug effects Depressive Disorder / cerebrospinal fluid* Depressive Disorder / drug therapy* Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors / therapeutic use Female Humans Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins* Male Neuropeptides / cerebrospinal fluid* Neuropeptides / drug effects Orexins Radioimmunoassay Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors / therapeutic use Sertraline / therapeutic useQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "This study was undertaken to investigate regional metabolic abnormalities and to determine the effects of modafinil in narcoleptics on cerebral glucose metabolism using [(18)F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET). Eight narcoleptic patients participated in the study. Two [(18)F] FDG PET scans were obtained before and after 2 weeks of modafinil treatment. To identify the effect of modafinil on regional cerebral abnormalities in narcoleptics, pre- and post-treatment PET scans were compared using paired t-statistics with voxel-wised manner. In narcolepsy patients, significant decreases in cerebral glucose metabolism were observed in the midbrain and upper pons, bilateral hypothalamus, posterior thalamus, hippocampus and right parahippocampus as compared with healthy subjects. After treatment, a significant increase in glucose metabolism in the left hippocampus was found in comparison with pre-treatment scan. This study demonstrated that modafinil activates the hippocampus which receives the afferents from hypothalamus, the center of sleep-wake rhythm.Adolescent Adult Benzhydryl Compounds / pharmacology* Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use Brain Mapping Brain Stem / diagnostic imaging Brain Stem / drug effects Brain Stem / metabolism Central Nervous System Stimulants / pharmacology* Central Nervous System Stimulants / therapeutic use Energy Metabolism / drug effects Female Fluorodeoxyglucose F18 Functional Laterality / drug effects Glucose / metabolism Hippocampus / diagnostic imaging Hippocampus / drug effects* Hippocampus / metabolism* Humans Hypothalamus / diagnostic imaging Hypothalamus / drug effects Hypothalamus / metabolism Male Modafinil Narcolepsy / diagnostic imaging Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Narcolepsy / physiopathology* Neural Pathways / diagnostic imaging Neural Pathways / drug effects Neural Pathways / metabolism Positron-Emission Tomography Sleep Thalamus / diagnostic imaging Thalamus / drug effects Thalamus / metabolism Treatment Outcome WakefulnessQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "To estimate the effect of the compound sodium oxybate (SO) on chin muscle tone in sleep, a re-analysis of the results of the international multicenter study SXB-15 was performed, applying a validated semi-automatic analysis of muscle tone. This analysis distinguishes short (<0.5 s) and long (>0.5 s) muscle activity indices per hour (SMI, LMI) in 116 patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy. While stable stimulant medication was permitted, tricyclics and SSRIs were withdrawn. Polysomnographies were performed at baseline (V5), four weeks after titration of SO to 4.5 g, 6 g, or 9 g or placebo (V6) and after another four weeks on stable SO dose (V7).\n",
      "SMI and LMI decreased significantly during light sleep. LMI remained stable in all SO groups during slow wave sleep (SWS), but decreased significantly during REM sleep. SMI decreased non-significantly, but consistently during SWS and REM in the 9 g group only. A subgroup analysis of patients who stayed on stimulants showed that they had higher SMIs and LMIs in all groups. Patients who had been treated with anticataplectic medication prior to study inclusion had lower LMIs in the 9 g group during REM sleep in all visits.\n",
      "SO has a differential effect on muscle tone that is dose and sleep stage dependent. Low dosages increase short muscle activity, possibly enabling the occurrence of parasomnias. High doses are especially efficacious in REM sleep, suggesting that SO could be used to treat REM sleep behavior disorder. Comedication with stimulants and prior medication with anticataplectic medication exerts an influence on muscle tone.Adult Central Nervous System Stimulants / therapeutic use Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Double-Blind Method Female Humans Male Movement / drug effects Movement / physiology Multivariate Analysis Muscle Tonus / drug effects* Muscle, Skeletal / drug effects Muscle, Skeletal / physiopathology Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Narcolepsy / physiopathology Polysomnography Sleep Aids, Pharmaceutical / therapeutic use* Sleep Stages / drug effects Sleep Stages / physiology Sodium Oxybate / therapeutic use*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "The discovery that hypocretins are involved in narcolepsy, a disorder associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and unusually rapid transitions to rapid eye movement sleep, opens a new field of investigation in the area of disorders of sleep and activation. Hypocretin-1 (hcrt-1) and hypocretin-2 (hcrt-2) (also called orexin-A and orexin-B) are newly discovered neuropeptides processed from a common precursor. Hypocretin containing cells are located exclusively in the lateral hypothalamus, with widespread projections within the central nervous system. The role of the hypocretin system in other disorders causing excessive daytime sleepiness is more uncertain. This study reports the findings of a prospective study measuring cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of hypocretin-1 and hypocretin-2 in HLA DQB1*0602 positive narcolepsy with cataplexy, monosymptomatic narcolepsy, and primary hypersomnia. The results confirmed the previous observations, that hcrt-1 is deficient in narcolepsy and for the first time report very low levels of hcrt-1 in primary hypersomnia. It is also reported for the first time that there is a generalised defect in hcrt-2 transmission in all three of these clinical entities compared with controls.Adult Aged Carrier Proteins / cerebrospinal fluid* Cataplexy / cerebrospinal fluid* Cataplexy / immunology Disorders of Excessive Somnolence / cerebrospinal fluid* Disorders of Excessive Somnolence / immunology Female HLA-DQ Antigens / analysis HLA-DQ beta-Chains Humans Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins* Male Middle Aged Narcolepsy / cerebrospinal fluid* Narcolepsy / immunology Neuropeptides / cerebrospinal fluid* Neuropeptides / deficiency* Orexins Predictive Value of Tests Prospective Studies Reference ValuesQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Prognosis in childhood craniopharyngioma survivors hinges upon late effects such as pituitary deficiency and obesity. Observations indicate that reduced physical activity and increased daytime sleepiness might be risk factors for obesity. We analyzed the degree of daytime sleepiness in 115 childhood craniopharyngioma patients (47% obese) using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Thirty-five (30%) displayed increased daytime sleepiness (ESS score > 10) of whom 14 were obese (26% of obese cohort). Polysomnography (PSG) and Multiple Sleep Latency Tests (MSLT) were conducted with 10 obese patients presenting increased daytime sleepiness, with only two craniopharyngioma patients revealing a sleep related breathing disorder. Four patients had repeated episodes of SOREM (sleep onset rapid eye movement), the classic PSG criterion for narcolepsy. Three patients displayed hypersomnia. All but one patient qualified as acutely obese. We speculate that secondary narcolepsy is an exacerbating condition of childhood craniopharyngioma obesity, supported by recent reports on orexin and narcolepsy which suggest hypothalamic failure in idiopathic narcolepsy.Adolescent Adult Body Mass Index Central Nervous System Stimulants / therapeutic use Child Cohort Studies Craniopharyngioma / complications* Female HLA Antigens / metabolism Humans Male Narcolepsy / drug therapy Narcolepsy / etiology* Obesity / complications* Pituitary Neoplasms / complications* Polysomnography Risk Factors Sleep / physiology Sleep StagesQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

Patients had to have baseline Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores ≥10 and mean sleep latencies ≤10 min on the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT). Efficacy end points included MWT sleep latency and ESS, and the percentage of patients improved on the Clinical Global Impression of Change.\n",
      "Patients were primarily male (57.6%) and white (69.7%), with a mean (standard deviation) age of 37.1 (12.4) years. At two weeks, the change in the mean MWT sleep latency was 11.8 min longer with JZP-110 than with placebo (P = 0.0002); JZP-110 resulted in greater changes in sleep latency on each MWT trial (P <0.001). For ESS, JZP-110 was more efficacious relative to placebo after 1 (P <0.0001) and two weeks (P = 0.0002); final ESS scores were 10.8 with JZP-110 and 15.2 with placebo, changes of -6.7 and -2.4, respectively. JZP-110 was generally well tolerated; the most common adverse events with JZP-110 were nausea (12%), noncardiac chest discomfort (9.1%), and headache (9.1%).\n",

      "This study examined the correlation between improvements in excessive daytime sleepiness in participants with obstructive sleep apnea or narcolepsy and changes in functional status, work productivity and health-related quality of life. Data from two 12-week randomized controlled trials of solriamfetol were analyzed. Participants completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, 10-item Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey and performed the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test at baseline and weeks 4, 8 and 12. Patient Global Impression of Change was assessed at weeks 4, 8 and 12. Pearson correlations were calculated for change in scores from baseline to week 12. For both studies, changes in the 10-item Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire were highly correlated (absolute value >0.5) with changes in Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores; changes in multiple domain scores of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire were moderately correlated (0.3-0.5) with changes in Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores in both studies and highly correlated for participants with narcolepsy. Changes in Maintenance of Wakefulness Test scores correlated moderately with changes in Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores in both studies. At week 12, Patient Global Impression of Change ratings correlated highly with Epworth Sleepiness Scale and 10-item Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire scores for both disorders. Other correlations were low. Self-reported assessments of sleepiness and global improvement appear to be more strongly correlated with measures of functioning and health-related quality of life than objectively assessed sleepiness.Disorders of Excessive Somnolence / physiopathology* Double-Blind Method Female Functional Status Humans Male Middle Aged Narcolepsy / psychology* Quality of Life / psychology* Sleep Apnea, Obstructive / psychology* Treatment OutcomeQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is widely considered a prodromal synucleinopathy, as most with RBD develop overt synucleinopathy within ~10 years. Accordingly, RBD offers an opportunity to test potential treatments at the earliest stages of synucleinopathy. The North American Prodromal Synucleinopathy (NAPS) Consortium has created a multisite RBD participant, primarily clinic-based cohort to better understand characteristics at diagnosis, and in future work, identify predictors of phenoconversion, develop synucleinopathy biomarkers, and enable early stage clinical trial enrollment.\n",
      "Participants ≥18 years of age with overnight polysomnogram-confirmed RBD without Parkinson's disease, dementia, multiple system atrophy, or narcolepsy were enrolled from nine sites across North America (8/2018 to 4/2021). Data collection included family/personal history of RBD and standardized assessments of cognitive, motor, sensory, and autonomic function.\n",

      "Previous research suggests that the neuropeptide orexin A contributes to sympathetic blood pressure (BP) control inasmuch as hypothalamic injection of orexin A increases sympathetic vasomotor tone and arterial BP in rodents. In humans with narcolepsy, a disorder associated with loss of orexin-producing neurons, vasoconstrictive muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) is reduced. Since intranasally administered oligopeptides like orexin are known to modulate brain function, we investigated the effect of intranasal orexin A on vascular sympathetic baroreflex function in healthy humans. In a balanced, double-blind crossover study, orexin A (500 nmol) and placebo, respectively, were intranasally administered to 10 lean healthy males (age 25.8 ± 4.6 yr). MSNA was assessed microneurographically before and 30-45 min after either substance administration. Additionally, baroreflex was challenged via graded infusions of vasoactive drugs before and after substance administration. Baroreflex function was defined as the correlation of BP with MSNA and heart rate. Intranasal orexin A compared with placebo induced a significant increase in resting MSNA from pre-to postadministration [Δburst rate, orexin A vs. placebo: +5.8 ± 0.8 vs. +2.1 ± 0.6 bursts/min, Administration, Intranasal Adult Baroreflex / drug effects* Blood Pressure / drug effects* Cross-Over Studies Double-Blind Method Heart Rate / drug effects* Humans Male Orexins / administration & dosage Orexins / pharmacology* Pilot Projects Sympathetic Nervous System / drug effects* Vasoconstriction / drug effects* Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Lower-sodium oxybate (LXB) is an oxybate medication with the same active moiety as sodium oxybate (SXB) and a unique composition of cations, resulting in 92% less sodium. LXB was shown to improve cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness in people with narcolepsy in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized withdrawal study (NCT03030599). Additional analyses of data from this study were conducted to explore the effects of LXB on cataplexy, including the clinical course and feasibility of transition from other anticataplectics to LXB monotherapy.\n",
      "The aim of these analyses was to evaluate cataplexy frequency during initiation/optimization of LXB and taper/discontinuation of prior antidepressant/anticataplectic medications.\n",
      "Eligible participants (adults aged 18-70 years with narcolepsy with cataplexy) entered the study taking SXB only (group A), SXB + other anticataplectics (group B), or anticataplectic medication other than SXB (group C), or were cataplexy-treatment naive (group D). LXB was initiated/optimized during a 12-week, open-label, optimized treatment and titration period (OLOTTP). Other anticataplectics were tapered/discontinued during weeks 3-10 of OLOTTP. A 2-week stable-dose period (SDP; during which participants took a stable dose of open-label LXB) and 2-week double-blind randomized withdrawal period (during which participants were randomized to continue LXB treatment or switch to placebo) followed OLOTTP. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were recorded throughout the duration of the study.\n",
      "At the beginning of OLOTTP, median weekly cataplexy attacks were lower in participants taking SXB at study entry (SXB only [2.00]; SXB + other anticataplectics [0.58]) versus participants who were taking other anticataplectics (3.50) or were anticataplectic naive (5.83). Median weekly cataplexy attacks decreased during weeks 1-2 of OLOTTP in all groups. Increased cataplexy frequency was observed in participants tapering/discontinuing other anticataplectics during weeks 3-10 and was more prominent in participants taking other anticataplectics alone compared with those taking SXB plus other anticataplectics. Cataplexy frequency decreased throughout initiation/optimization in anticataplectic-naive participants. Median number of cataplexy-free days/week at the end of SDP (study week 14) was similar in all groups (6.0, 6.1, 6.0, and 6.2 in groups A, B, C, and D, respectively). During OLOTTP and SDP, TEAEs of worsening cataplexy were reported in 0%, 47.8%, 16.7%, and 2.2% of participants in groups A, B, C, and D, respectively; most TEAEs of worsening cataplexy were reported during tapering/discontinuation of other anticataplectics.\n",
      "LXB monotherapy was effective in reducing cataplexy and increasing cataplexy-free days. These results illustrate the feasibility of switching from SXB to LXB while tapering/discontinuing other anticataplectics.\n",

      "People with narcolepsy are often sleepy during the day. They may also have sudden muscle weakness (known as cataplexy). Lower-sodium oxybate (LXB) is a narcolepsy medicine that is similar to sodium oxybate (SXB) but has 92% less sodium. A recent study found that treatment with LXB was better at reducing how often people with narcolepsy had sleepiness and cataplexy than no medicine at all (NCT03030599). This paper is about the first 12 weeks of that study, when all the people taking part in the study first tried LXB to check that they were being given the right amount. In people who only took LXB, cataplexy happened less often over time. Some people were already taking other medicines to treat their cataplexy (such as antidepressants), so they were asked to slowly stop those medicines while taking LXB. In those people, cataplexy happened more often at first as they stopped taking antidepressants and then less often later on. The increase in cataplexy when antidepressants were stopped was smaller in people who switched from SXB to LXB. This study shows that many people getting treatment for narcolepsy can switch to LXB without their cataplexy becoming worse.Adult Cataplexy* / drug therapy Disorders of Excessive Somnolence* / drug therapy Double-Blind Method Humans Narcolepsy* / chemically induced Narcolepsy* / drug therapy Sodium Oxybate* / adverse effectsQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) showed a functional deterioration of the fronto-temporo-parietal network of the right hemispheric vigilance system in narcolepsy and a therapeutic effect of modafinil. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of modafinil on cognitive and thymopsychic variables in patients with narcolepsy and investigate whether neurophysiological vigilance changes correlate with cognitive and subjective vigilance alterations at the behavioral level. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, EEG-LORETA and psychometric data were obtained during midmorning hours in 15 narcoleptics before and after 3 weeks of placebo or 400 mg modafinil. Cognitive investigations included the Pauli Test and complex reaction time. Thymopsychic/psychophysiological evaluation comprised drive, mood, affectivity, wakefulness, depression, anxiety, the Symptom Checklist 90 and critical flicker frequency. The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) were performed too. Cognitive performance (Pauli Test) was significantly better after modafinil than after placebo. Concerning reaction time and thymopsychic variables, no significant differences were observed. Correlation analyses revealed that a decrease in prefrontal delta, theta and alpha-1 power correlated with an improvement in cognitive performance. Moreover, drowsiness was positively correlated with theta power in parietal and medial prefrontal regions and beta-1 and beta-2 power in occipital regions. A less significant correlation was observed between midmorning EEG LORETA and the MSLT; between EEG LORETA and the ESS, the correlation was even weaker. In conclusion, modafinil did not influence thymopsychic variables in narcolepsy, but it significantly improved cognitive performance, which may be related to medial prefrontal activity processes identified by LORETA.Adult Affect / drug effects Arousal / drug effects Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use* Brain Mapping Central Nervous System Stimulants / therapeutic use* Cognition / drug effects Cross-Over Studies Double-Blind Method Drive Electroencephalography / drug effects* Female Fourier Analysis Humans Image Processing, Computer-Assisted* Imaging, Three-Dimensional* Magnetic Resonance Imaging* Male Middle Aged Modafinil Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Neuropsychological Tests Occipital Lobe / drug effects Polysomnography Prefrontal Cortex / drug effects Reaction Time / drug effects Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted Software Wakefulness / drug effectsQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "To evaluate the reliability of actigraphy to distinguish the features of estimated daytime and nighttime sleep between patients with central disorders of hypersomnolence and healthy controls.\n",
      "Thirty-nine drug-naïve patients with Narcolepsy Type 1, twenty-four drug-naïve patients with Idiopathic Hypersomnia, and thirty age- and sex- matched healthy controls underwent seven days of actigraphic and self-report monitoring of sleep/wake behavior. The following variables were examined: estimated time in bed (eTIB), estimated total sleep time, estimated sleep latency (eSOL), estimated sleep efficiency, estimated wake after sleep onset, number of estimated awakenings (eAwk), number of estimated awakenings longer than 5 minutes, estimated sleep motor activity (eSMA), number of estimated naps, mean duration of the longest estimated nap (eNapD), and daytime motor activity.\n",
      "All actigraphic parameters significantly differentiated the three groups, except eTIB and eSOL. A discriminant score computed combining actigraphic parameters from nighttime (eSMA, eAwk) and daytime (eNapD) periods showed a wide area under the curve (0.935) and a good balance between positive (95%) and negative predictive (87%) values in Narcolepsy Type 1 cases.\n",
      "Actigraphy provided a reliable objective measurement of sleep quality and daytime napping behavior able to distinguish central disorders of hypersomnolence and in particular Narcolepsy Type 1.

      "Actigraphy is commonly used to measure sleep outcomes so that sleep can be measured conveniently at home over multiple nights. Actigraphy has been validated in people with sleep disturbances; however, the validity of scoring settings in people with chronic medical illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease remains unclear. The purpose of this secondary analysis was to compare actigraphy-customized scoring settings with polysomnography (PSG) for the measurement of sleep outcomes in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who have insomnia.\n",
      "Participants underwent overnight sleep assessment simultaneously by PSG and actigraphy at the University of Illinois of Chicago Sleep Science Center. Fifty participants (35 men and 15 women) with mild-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and co-existing insomnia were included in the analysis. Sleep onset latency, total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep efficiency (SE) were calculated independently from data derived from PSG and actigraphy. Actigraphy sleep outcome scores obtained at the default setting and several customized actigraphy settings were compared to the scored PSG results.\n",
      "Although no single setting was optimal for all sleep outcomes, the combination of 10 consecutive immobile minutes for sleep onset or end and an activity threshold of 10 worked well. Actigraphy overestimated TST and SE and underestimated WASO, but there was no difference in variance between PSG and actigraphy in TST and SE when the 10 × 10 combination was used. As the average TST and SE increased, the agreement between PSG and actigraphy appeared to increase, and as the average WASO decreased, the agreement between PSG and actigraphy appeared to increase.\n",

      "Modafinil improves wakefulness and attention, is approved in Japan for treatment of narcolepsy, and was reported to be effective for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. However, it was reported to induce emotional instability, including mania, depression, and suicidal ideation. Such side effects may be related to changes in cognitive behavior caused by the effects of modafinil on emotional recognition. However, the effects of modafinil on the neural basis of emotional processing have not been fully verified. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the effects of modafinil on the neural basis of auditory emotional processing.\n",
      "This study adopted a placebo-controlled within-subject crossover design. Data from 14 participants were analyzed. The effects of modafinil on cerebral activation and task performance during an emotional judgement task were analyzed.\n",
      "Task accuracy decreased significantly and response time of emotional judgement was significantly delayed by modafinil, as compared with placebo. Right thalamic activation in auditory emotional processing was significantly less in the modafinil condition than in the placebo condition. In addition, reduction of right thalamic activation by modafinil was positively correlated with accuracy of emotional judgement.\n",
      "Our findings suggest that modafinil acts on the right thalamus and changes behavior and brain function associated with auditory emotional processing.

      "The goal of this multi-method study was to examine the validity (accuracy) of the pupillometric Alertness Level Test (ALT) as a physiologic measure of sleepiness. The study used a pooled-time series-correlation design with 16 untreated narcolepsy (8 F, 8 M), 16 untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (7 F, 9 M) and 16 healthy control (8 F, 8 M) subjects. Participants underwent EEG/polysomnography testing using standard Multiple Sleep Latency Test electrode placement concurrent with the 15 min pupillometric ALT. EEG data were examined to determine if theta power (4-7 Hz) increased during 2-s periods of proportional pupil size decreases (pupil Stage 1, 95% or more of maximal pupil size to Stage 4, 65-74% of maximal size). Printed EEG records also were visually scored. Self-report sleepiness measures included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Profile of Mood States and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Within subject groups, theta power ratios significantly increased across pupil stages for the sleep disorder groups but not for controls (theta activity increased 42% for narcoleptic and 36% for OSA subjects). Between subject groups, the amount of theta activity was significantly greater for narcoleptic and OSA subjects than that for controls. Visual EEG scoring and self-report measures were usually consistent with objective findings. The ALT is convenient, easily repeatable and less technically demanding than EEG sleepiness measures, and it deserves more comprehensive testing as a valid measure of sleepiness.Adult Electroencephalography* Female Humans Male Middle Aged Narcolepsy / physiopathology* Polysomnography Pupil / physiology* Sleep Stages / physiology* Theta RhythmQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Fatigue is a common symptom that lowers the quality of life of patients with cancer, affecting between 60% and 90% of patients. Relatively few options are available for the treatment of this debilitating condition. Modafinal, a psychostimulant developed for the treatment of narcolepsy, has been used to treat fatigue in other diseases such as multiple sclerosis, but little data support its use in cancer patients.\n",
      "The primary objective of this open-label pilot study was to evaluate the safety, and efficacy of modafinil in improving cancer-related fatigue (CRF) as measured by the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI). The effect of this agent on depression, quality of life, functional status, and cognitive function was also assessed. Modafinal was self-administered at a dose of 100 mg/d during weeks 1-2, and 200 mg during weeks 3-4. Assessments were performed at baseline, 2, and 4 weeks.\n",
      "BFI score was improved in 46% of patients at 2 weeks and 75% at 4 weeks (p = 0.025). Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores declined at 2 and 4 weeks (p < 0.001). Most scales for neurocognitive function were unchanged. Score for all Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-BR) subscales (measuring quality of life), except social/family well-being, were improved (p < 0.05) at 2 and 4 weeks. Significant changes in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status were noted, with 40% of patients improving at least one level. Modafinil was well-tolerated with only one patient discontinuing treatment due to drug-related toxicity.\n",
      "In this pilot study modafinil was well-tolerated and effective for fatigue in patients with cancer. Improvements were also seen in mood, quality of life, and functional status.Activities of Daily Living Affect / drug effects Benzhydryl Compounds / adverse effects Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use* Central Nervous System Stimulants / adverse effects Central Nervous System Stimulants / therapeutic use* Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions Fatigue / drug therapy* Fatigue / etiology Female Humans Male Middle Aged Modafinil Neoplasms / complications* Pilot Projects Quality of Life VirginiaQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Although many animal and human studies have been performed, the exact mechanisms of action whereby modafinil promotes wakefulness are still not completely understood. We aimed to investigate the functional effects of modafinil on motor cortex excitability in patients with narcolepsy by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) techniques.\n",
      "In a double-blind and placebo-controlled design, 24 drug-naive narcoleptic patients with cataplexy and 20 control subjects were administered modafinil or placebo over a period of 4 weeks. TMS was performed twice during the awake state before and at the end of treatment; measures of cortical excitability included central motor conduction time, resting motor threshold, short latency intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation to paired-TMS. TMS measures were correlated with the conventional neurophysiological method of Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and the subjective Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS).\n",
      "As previously reported, motor threshold and SICI were significantly increased in patients with narcolepsy; modafinil reversed this cortical hypoexcitability, but only SICI differences reached statistical significance. The Spearman rank correlation analysis revealed the highest correlation between SICI and the MSLT; a positive correlation was also found between SICI and the ESS, as well as between RMT and both measures of daytime sleepiness.\n",
      "This represents the first report investigating effects of modafinil on cortical excitability in human narcolepsy. Since SICI is thought to be directly related to GABA(A) intracortical inhibitory activity, we demonstrated that the dose of modafinil that induces a satisfactory wakefulness-promoting response in narcoleptic patients also causes decrease in GABAergic transmission.Adult Benzhydryl Compounds / pharmacology Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use* Central Nervous System Stimulants / pharmacology Central Nervous System Stimulants / therapeutic use* Double-Blind Method Evoked Potentials, Motor / drug effects Evoked Potentials, Motor / physiology Female Humans Male Middle Aged Modafinil Motor Cortex / drug effects* Motor Cortex / physiopathology Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Narcolepsy / physiopathology Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation* Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Modafinil is employed for the treatment of narcolepsy and has also been, off-label, used to treat cognitive dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders. In a previous study, we have reported that single dose administration of modafinil in healthy young subjects enhances fluid reasoning and affects resting state activity in the Fronto Parietal Control (FPC) and Dorsal Attention (DAN) networks. No changes were found in the Salience Network (SN), a surprising result as the network is involved in the modulation of emotional and fluid reasoning. The insula is crucial hub of the SN and functionally divided in anterior and posterior subregions.\n",
      "Using a seed-based approach, we have now analyzed effects of modafinil on the functional connectivity (FC) of insular subregions.\n",
      "Analysis of FC with resting state fMRI (rs-FMRI) revealed increased FC between the right posterior insula and the putamen, the superior frontal gyrus and the anterior cingulate cortex in the modafinil-treated group.\n",

      "Armodafinil, prescribed principally to treat narcolepsy, is undergoing assessment of therapeutic potential for other neuropsychiatric disorders and medical conditions. The neurochemical substrates and mechanisms of armodafinil are unresolved. We investigated the hypothesis that armodafinil enhances wakefulness by modulating the activities of the dopamine transporter (DAT). With positron emission tomography imaging, we determined DAT occupancy and changes in extracellular dopamine by armodafinil in vivo.\n",
      "Twelve subjects were enrolled. Plasma armodafinil levels were obtained. In vivo armodafinil occupancy of the DAT in striatum was detected by [¹¹C]altropane and changes in extracellular dopamine were detected by indirect displacement of [¹¹C]raclopride in human subjects at different times after drug administration.\n",
      "Armodafinil (100 mg by mouth [PO]) occupied striatal DAT (34.0 ± 9.0% at 1 hour, 40.4 ± 9.5% at 2.5 hours, n = 6) and 250 mg occupied striatal DAT (60.5 ± 7.4% at 1 hour, 65.2 ± 6.1% at 2.5 hours, n = 6). In addition, armodafinil was associated with changes in extracellular dopamine (17.8 ± 30.1% [100 mg PO] and 7.0 ± 8.6% [250 mg PO] at 2.5 hours, n = 6).\n",

      "Twenty-seven narcoleptic patients severely affected with cataplexy completed four symptom diaries over a 4-month period in order to clarify some of the controversies surrounding assessment of anticataplectic medications. The home diary method was found to be a viable model for the assessment of anticataplectic activity. Assessment of reliability in 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5- and 10-day intervals indicated that reliability increases with the number of days included. A 10-day design was found to be optimal. Reliability decreased, however, with each successive diary over the 4-month period. Power analysis indicates that two groups of 30-40 subjects in a parallel design, or one group of 30-40 subjects in a crossover design, would be sufficient to demonstrate a significant therapeutic anticataplectic effect in most cases. A \"first diary effect\" was observed, suggesting that a training period prior to the actual trial might improve reliability. Whether the patient was treated or untreated with stimulant medications did not affect severity or fluctuation of cataplexy, suggesting that both groups of patients could be included in therapeutic trials. No time-of-day fluctuation was observed in the daily distribution of cataplexy attacks. Sudden increases in cataplexy were often, although not always, caused by unusual emotional events or sleepiness. The finding of a long-lasting \"precataplectic\" feeling or \"aura\" pointed to the need to carefully clarify the symptom prior to beginning a therapeutic trial.Catalepsy / diagnosis* Catalepsy / drug therapy Cross-Sectional Studies Double-Blind Method Female Humans Male Middle Aged Placebos Reproducibility of Results Self-Assessment Sleep, REM Surveys and Questionnaires Time FactorsQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is used recreationally and investigated as an adjunct to psychotherapy. Methylphenidate and modafinil are psychostimulants that are used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy, respectively, but they are also misused as cognitive enhancers. Little is known about differences in the acute effects of equally cardiostimulant doses of these stimulant-type substances compared directly within the same subjects.\n",
      "We investigated the acute autonomic, subjective, endocrine, and emotional effects of single doses of MDMA (125 mg), methylphenidate (60 mg), modafinil (600 mg), and placebo in a double-blind, cross-over study in 24 healthy participants. Acute drug effects were tested using psychometric scales, the Facial Emotion Recognition Task (FERT), and the Sexual Arousal and Desire Inventory (SADI).\n",
      "All active drugs produced comparable hemodynamic and adverse effects. MDMA produced greater increases in pupil dilation, subjective good drug effects, drug liking, happiness, trust, well-being, and alterations in consciousness than methylphenidate or modafinil. Only MDMA reduced subjective anxiety and impaired fear recognition and led to misclassifications of emotions as happy on the FERT. On the SADI, only MDMA produced sexual arousal-like effects. Only MDMA produced marked increases in cortisol, prolactin, and oxytocin. In contrast to MDMA, methylphenidate increased subjective anxiety, and methylphenidate and modafinil increased misclassifications of emotions as angry on the FERT. Modafinil had no significant subjective drug effects but significant sympathomimetic and adverse effects.\n",

It has both dopaminergic and glutamatergic activity that could be useful for the treatment of cocaine dependence. Modafinil has reduced cocaine subjective effects and cocaine self-administration in human laboratory trials and has reduced cocaine use in cocaine dependent patients in some clinical trials.\n",
      "This was an 8-week, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial involving 94 cocaine dependent subjects. Subjects received 300mg of modafinil or identical placebo daily along with weekly individual therapy. The primary outcome measure was cocaine use measured by self-report, and confirmed by twice weekly urine benzoylecgonine tests (UBT). Additional outcome measures included cocaine craving measured by the Brief Substance Craving Scale and global improvement measured by the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI).\n",
      "The odds ratio (OR) in favor of abstinence for modafinil vs. placebo was 2.54 (p=. 03) and modafinil-treated subjects were significantly more likely than placebo-treated subjects to be abstinent from cocaine during the last 3 weeks of the trial, 23% vs. 9%, χ(2)=3.9, p<.05. Modafinil treated subjects were more likely to report very low levels of cocaine craving intensity and duration on the Brief Substance Craving Scale (OR=2.04, p=.03 and OR 1.06, p=.03 respectively).

      "Narcolepsy, a rare disease with a prevalence of 0.05% in the general population, affects an estimated 140,000 patients in the United States. Patients have been able to lead fuller personal and professional lives since the Food and Drug Administration approved sodium oxybate (Xyrem) in 2002 for treatment of cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy. Previously, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), the active ingredient of sodium oxybate, had been a substance of abuse, most notoriously as a date-rape drug. Public Law 106-172, the date-rape prohibition act enacted in 2000, was modified to allow the drug to be legally administered for medical purposes. Because of the apprehension regarding the risk of possible drug diversion after the approval of sodium oxybate and concerns about safety, the Xyrem Risk Management Program was created. This program has been successful in satisfying the needs of patients and physicians while ensuring responsible distribution of the drug.Administration, Oral Cataplexy / drug therapy* Cataplexy / physiopathology Drug Approval* Humans Illicit Drugs* Orphan Drug Production* Product Surveillance, Postmarketing / methods Risk Management / organization & administration* Sodium Oxybate / administration & dosage Sodium Oxybate / adverse effects Sodium Oxybate / therapeutic use* United States United States Food and Drug AdministrationQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Many people with COPD report difficulties falling asleep or staying asleep, insufficient sleep duration, or nonrestorative sleep. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has proved effective not only in people with primary insomnia but also in people with insomnia comorbid with psychiatric and medical illness (eg, depression, cancer, and chronic pain). However, CBT-I has rarely been tested in those with COPD who have disease-related features that interfere with sleep and may lessen the effectiveness of such therapies. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of applying a CBT-I intervention for people with COPD and to assess the impact of CBT-I on insomnia severity and sleep-related outcomes, fatigue, mood, and daytime functioning.\n",
      "The study had two phases. In Phase 1, a 6-weekly session CBT-I intervention protocol in participants with COPD was assessed to examine feasibility and acceptability. Phase 2 was a small trial utilizing a prospective two-group pre- and post-test design with random assignment to the six-session CBT-I or a six-session wellness education (WE) program to determine the effects of each intervention, with both interventions being provided by a nurse behavioral sleep medicine specialist.\n",
      "Fourteen participants (five in Phase 1 and nine in Phase 2) completed six sessions of CBT-I and nine participants completed six sessions of WE. Participants indicated that both interventions were acceptable. Significant positive treatment-related effects of the CBT-I intervention were noted for insomnia severity (P = 0.000), global sleep quality (P = 0.002), wake after sleep onset (P = 0.03), sleep efficiency (P = 0.02), fatigue (P = 0.005), and beliefs and attitudes about sleep (P = 0.000). Significant positive effects were noted for depressed mood after WE (P = 0.005).\n",

      "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of acute ingestion of modafinil (M) on time to exhaustion during high-intensity exercise. Modafinil (M) is a psychostimulant developed to treat narcolepsy, with \"arousal\" properties attributed to an increased release of dopamine in the CNS. Because other stimulants with similar properties have ergogenic effects, it was hypothesized that acute treatment with M would enhance physical performance.\n",
      "Fifteen healthy male subjects, with a maximal aerobic power (VO2max) of 47 +/- SD 8 mL x kg x min, exercised on a cycle ergometer for 5 min at 50% VO2max and then at approximately 85% VO2max to exhaustion. They did this weekly for 3 wk: a control trial (C) the first week, and then 3 h after ingesting either placebo (P) or M (4 mg x kg) during the remaining 2 wk. The P and M trials were conducted with a balanced order, double-blind design.\n",
      ": Mean +/- SD times to exhaustion at 85% VO2max (TE) were 14.3 +/- 2.8, 15.6 +/- 3.8 and 18.3 +/- 3.5 min for the C, P, and M trials, respectively. TE for M was significantly longer than for the C and P trials. Oxygen uptake at exhaustion was slightly but significantly greater for M compared with P and C. HR increased with time and was further elevated by M. Subjective ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were significantly lower for M compared with C and P but only after 10 min of exercise at 85% VO2max.\n",
      "Acute ingestion of modafinil prolonged exercise time to exhaustion at 85% VO2max and reduced RPE.

      "Sleep of 8 narcoleptic and 8 control subjects was recorded under baseline (i.e., prior wakefulness 16 h) and after 24 h without sleep. During both baseline and recovery total sleep time and stage 2 non-REM sleep were significantly decreased in narcoleptic subjects. Slow wave activity (i.e., EEG power density in the range of 0.75-4.5 Hz) decayed exponentially during baseline and after sleep deprivation in both narcoleptic and control subjects. During both baseline and recovery EEG power density in delta and sigma frequencies in non-REM sleep was enhanced in narcoleptic subjects relative to controls. In REM sleep differences in the same direction were present in delta and beta frequencies. After sleep deprivation EEG power density in non-REM sleep was elevated in delta and some higher frequencies in both patients and controls, but the response to sleep deprivation was stronger in narcoleptic subjects. These data show that in narcoleptic subjects regulatory processes underlying non-REM sleep homeostasis are operative and indicate that the response to sleep deprivation is stronger than in control subjects.Adolescent Adult Electroencephalography Female Humans Male Narcolepsy / physiopathology* Sleep Deprivation / physiology* Sleep Stages / physiology*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Hypocretin (orexin) peptides are involved in the regulation of energy balance and pituitary hormone release. Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder characterized by disruption of hypocretin neurotransmission. Pituitary LH secretion is diminished in hypocretin-deficient animal models, and intracerebroventricular administration of hypocretin-1 activates the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis in rats. We evaluated whether hypocretin deficiency affects gonadotropin release in humans. To this end, we deconvolved 24-h serum concentrations of LH and FSH in seven hypocretin-deficient narcoleptic males (N) and seven controls (C) matched for age, body mass index, and sex. Basal plasma concentrations of testosterone, estradiol, and sex hormone-binding globulin were similar in both groups. Mean 24-h LH concentration was significantly lower in narcolepsy patients [3.0 +/- 0.4 (N) vs. 4.2 +/- 0.3 (C) U/l, P = 0.01], which was primarily due to a reduction of pulsatile LH secretion [23.5 +/- 1.6 (N) vs. 34.3 +/- 4.9 (C) U.l(-1).24 h(-1), P = 0.02]. The orderliness of LH and FSH secretion, quantitated by the approximate entropy statistic, was greater in patients than in controls. In contrast, all other features of FSH release were similar in narcoleptic and control groups. Also, LH and FSH secretions in response to intravenous administration of 100 microg of GnRH were similar in patients and controls. These data indicate that endogenous hypocretins are involved in the regulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis activity in humans. In particular, reduced LH release in the face of normal pituitary responsivity to GnRH stimulation in narcoleptic men suggests that hypocretins promote endogenous GnRH secretion.Adult Carrier Proteins Entropy Fluorescent Antibody Technique Follicle Stimulating Hormone / metabolism* Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Humans Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins* Leptin / blood Luteinizing Hormone / metabolism* Male Middle Aged Narcolepsy / metabolism* Neuropeptides / deficiency* Orexins Radioimmunoassay Testosterone / bloodQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be used to detect regional brain responses to changes in sensory stimuli. We have used fMRI to determine the amount of visual and auditory cortical activation in 12 normal subjects and 12 subjects with the narcoleptic syndrome, using a multiplexed visual and auditory stimulation paradigm. In both normal and narcoleptic subjects, mean cortical activation levels during the presentation of periodic visual and auditory stimulation showed no appreciable differences with either age or sex. Normal subjects showed higher levels of visual activation at 10:00 hours than 15:00 hours, with a reverse pattern in narcoleptic subjects (P = 0.007). The group differences in spatial extent of cortical activation between control and narcoleptic subjects were small and statistically insignificant. The alerting action, and imaging response, to a single oral dose of the sleep-preventing drug modafinil 400 mg were then determined and compared with placebo in both the 12 normal (8 given modafinil, 4 placebo) and 12 narcoleptic subjects (8 modafinil, 4 placebo). Modafinil caused an increase in self-reported levels of alertness in 7 of 8 narcoleptic subjects, but there was no significant difference between mean pretreatment and post-treatment activation levels as determined by fMRI for either normal or narcoleptic syndrome subjects given modafinil. However, in the modafinil-treated group of 8 normal and 8 narcoleptic subjects, there was a clock time independent correlation between the initial level of activation as determined by the pretreatment scan and the post-treatment change in activation (visual, P = 0.002; and auditory, P = 0.001). No correlation was observed in placebo-treated subjects (P = 0.99 and 0.77, respectively). Although limited by the small number of subjects, and the lack of an objective measure of alertness, the findings of this study suggest that low cortical activation levels in both normal and narcoleptic subjects are increased following the administration of modafinil.

      "To investigate the efficacy and cognitive and psychomotor effects of venlafaxine and dothiepin in elderly patients with moderate major depression. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active comparator controlled study was conducted. Eighty-eight patients (aged > or = 60 years) were enrolled. Each patient received either venlafaxine (immediate release formulation) 37.5 mg twice per day or dothiepin 25 mg mane followed by 50 mg nocte for 26 weeks. Efficacy was assessed with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. A psychometric test battery to assess cognitive function, activities of daily living and sleep consisted of Critical Flicker Fusion (CFF), Short-term Memory--Kim's Game, Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, Milford Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire, and an Accident Scoring Questionnaire. Quality of Life Questionnaires (Short Form 36 and Quality of Life in Depression Scale) were also administered. Venlafaxine significantly (p < 0.05) raised CFF scores compared to baseline but had no effect on any other measure. Dothiepin significantly (p < 0.05) lowered CFF threshold, and increased ratings of both sedation and difficulty in waking. The results showed that venlafaxine at doses of 37.5 mg b.i.d. in elderly depressed patients is free from disruptive effects on cognitive function and psychomotor performance.Aged Cognition / drug effects* Cognition / physiology Cyclohexanols / administration & dosage Cyclohexanols / adverse effects Cyclohexanols / therapeutic use* Depressive Disorder / diagnosis Depressive Disorder / drug therapy* Disorders of Excessive Somnolence / chemically induced Dizziness / chemically induced Dizziness / etiology Dothiepin / administration & dosage Dothiepin / adverse effects Dothiepin / therapeutic use* Double-Blind Method Drug Administration Schedule Female Flicker Fusion / drug effects Humans Male Narcolepsy / chemically induced Narcolepsy / etiology Nausea / chemically induced Nausea / etiology Psychometrics / methods Psychomotor Performance / drug effects* Psychomotor Performance / physiology Time Factors Venlafaxine HydrochlorideQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Mazindol is a tricyclic, anorectic, non-amphetamine stimulant used in narcolepsy and obesity since 1970. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term benefit/risk ratio in drug-resistant hypersomniacs and cataplexy sufferers.\n",
      "By retrospective analysis of the patients' files in the hospitals of Paris-Salpêtrière (n=91), Montpellier (n=40) and Lyon (n=8), the benefit (Epworth Sleepiness Score (ESS), cataplexy frequency, authorization renewal) and tolerance (side-effects, vital signs, electrocardiogram and cardiac echography) of mazindol were assessed.\n",
      "The 139 patients (45% men) aged 36±15years (range: 9-74) suffered narcolepsy (n=94, 66% with cataplexy), idiopathic (n=37) and symptomatic hypersomnia (n=8) refractory to modafinil, methylphenidate and sodium oxybate. Under mazindol (3.4±1.3mg/day, 1-6mg) for an average of 30months, the ESS decreased from 17.7±3.5 to 12.8±5.1, with an average fall of -4.6±4.7 (p<0.0001) and the frequency of cataplexy fell from 4.6±3.1 to 2±2.8 episodes per week. The cataplexy was eliminated in 14.5% of patients, improved in 27.5%, and unchanged in 29% (missing data in 29%). The treatment was maintained long term in 83 (60%) patients, and stopped because of a lack of efficacy (22%) and/or secondary effects (9%). There was no pulmonary hypertension in the 45 patients who underwent a cardiac echography. The most common adverse effects were dry mouth (13%), palpitations (10%, including one with ventricular hyperexcitability), anorexia (6%), nervousness (6%) and headaches (6%).\n",

      "Eight pairs of subjects (each consisting of a narcoleptic and a control matched on the basis of age, sex, educational background and job) were evaluated under the following double-blind, randomized treatment conditions: baseline, placebo, low dose and high dose methamphetamine. Subjects were drug-free for 2 weeks prior to beginning the protocol. Methamphetamine was the only drug taken during the protocol and was given in a single morning dose of 0, 20 or 40-60 mg to narcoleptics and 0, 5 or 10 mg to controls. The protocol was 28 days long, with each of the four treatment conditions lasting 4 days followed by 3 days of washout. Nighttime polysomnography and daytime testing were done during the last 24 hours of each treatment condition. Daytime sleep tendency was assessed with the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). Daytime performance was assessed with performance tests including a simple, computer-based driving task. Narcoleptics' mean MSLT sleep latency increased from 4.3 minutes on placebo to 9.3 minutes on high dose, compared with an increase from 10.4 to 17.1 minutes for controls. Narcoleptics' error rate on the driving task decreased from 2.53% on placebo to 0.33% on high dose, compared with a decrease from 0.22% to 0.16% for controls. The effects of methamphetamine on nocturnal sleep were generally dose-dependent and affected sleep continuity and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Elimination half life was estimated to be between 15.9 and 22.0 hours. Mild side effects emerged in a dose-dependent fashion and most often involved the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. We concluded that methamphetamine caused a dose-dependent decrease in daytime sleep tendency and improvement in performance in both narcoleptics and controls. Methamphetamine at doses of 40-60 mg allowed narcoleptics to function at levels comparable to those of unmedicated controls.Adult Brain / drug effects Cross-Sectional Studies Delusions / chemically induced Double-Blind Method Female Heart Rate / drug effects Humans Hypertension / chemically induced Male Methamphetamine / adverse effects Methamphetamine / pharmacology Methamphetamine / therapeutic use* Narcolepsy / diagnosis Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Polysomnography Sleep, REM / drug effects Task Performance and AnalysisQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Sodium oxybate has been recognized as a gold standard for the treatment of disrupted nighttime sleep due to narcolepsy. Its short half-life and immediate-release formulation require patients to awaken 2.5-4 h after their bedtime dose to take a second dose. A novel extended-release, once-nightly sodium oxybate formulation (ON-SXB; FT218) is under US Food and Drug Administration review for the treatment of adults with narcolepsy.\n",
      "A phase III trial of ON-SXB in individuals with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) or 2 (NT2) [the REST-ON trial; NCT02720744] has been conducted and the primary results reported elsewhere. Secondary objectives from REST-ON were to assess the efficacy of ON-SXB on disrupted nighttime sleep; the results of this analysis are reported here.\n",
      "In the double-blind, phase III REST-ON trial, patients aged ≥ 16 years were randomly assigned 1:1 to ON-SXB (1 week, 4.5 g; 2 weeks, 6 g; 5 weeks, 7.5 g; 5 weeks, 9 g) or placebo. Secondary endpoints included polysomnographic measures of sleep stage shifts and nocturnal arousals and patient-reported assessments of sleep quality and refreshing nature of sleep at 6, 7.5, and 9 g; post hoc analyses included changes in time spent in each sleep stage, delta power, and assessments in stimulant-use subgroups for prespecified endpoints.\n",
      "In total, 190 participants (n = 97, ON-SXB; n = 93, placebo) were included in the efficacy analyses. All three ON-SXB doses demonstrated a clinically meaningful, statistically significant decrease vs placebo in the number of transitions to wake/N1 from N1, N2, and rapid eye movement (REM) stages (all doses p < 0.001) and the number of nocturnal arousals (p < 0.05 ON-SXB 6 g; p < 0.001 7.5 and 9 g). Sleep quality and refreshing nature of sleep were significantly improved with all three ON-SXB doses vs placebo (p < 0.001). Post hoc analyses revealed a significant reduction in time spent in N1 (p < 0.05 ON-SXB 6 g; p < 0.001 7.5 and 9 g) and REM (all p < 0.001) and increased time spent in N3 with ON-SXB vs placebo (all p < 0.001), with a significant increase in delta power (p < 0.01 ON-SXB 6 g; p < 0.05 7.5 g; p < 0.001 9 g) and increased REM latency (ON-SXB 7.5 g vs placebo; p < 0.05). Significant improvements in disrupted nighttime sleep were observed regardless of concomitant stimulant use.\n",

Each drug was given for four weeks and the effects compared. In these dosages the reported frequency of attacks of narcolepsy was roughly halved with each treatment, dexamphetamine 30 mg daily being only slightly more potent than 10 mg. The subjective effects of Dexedrine tablets and Spansules could not be distinguished by most patients.

      "Nineteen drug-naïve narcolepsy patients with cataplexy (10 males, 9 females, and mean age 28.5 years) and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited. In this double-blind, randomized, crossover study, patients and controls received a single dose of 400mg modafinil or placebo. Modafinil and placebo administrations were separated by a 2-week washout period. TMS parameters, such as resting motor thresholds (RMT), motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes, cortical silent periods (CSP), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF), were measured before and 3h after administering modafinil or placebo. The differences of TMS parameters were statistically tested between patients and controls and between before and after modafinil or placebo administration.\n",
      "Narcolepsy patients had significantly increased CSP durations compared to controls (independent t-test, P<0.05), indicating decreased excitability of cortical networks in human narcolepsy. In patients after modafinil administration, MEP amplitudes, SICI, and ICF increased, and CSP duration shortened significantly, meaning enhanced motor excitability, whereas in controls modafinil did not change TMS parameters significantly. Placebo administration did not affect TMS parameters both in patients or controls.\n",

      "A randomized, double-blind, placebo-control clinical pilot trial was conducted with a parallel, two-arm trial allocation ratio of 1:1. Participants attended two study visits 7 days apart. The drug was administered orally in a single opaque capsule containing 200 mg caffeine/placebo daily in the morning for 1 week. Sleepiness was assessed objectively using infrared reflectance oculography to measure the percentage of long eye closure (LEC%) and subjectively using two sleepiness scales, the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) and Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). Parameters were measured at baseline (BL) prior to taking the drug, after taking the first dose (FD), and after 1 week (WD) of daily caffeine.\n",
      "Sixteen participants with narcolepsy were included. No significant differences between groups in baseline measurements were observed. LEC% was significantly decreased after the FD and WD compared with baseline levels (BL 1.4 ± 2.1 vs. FD 0.06 ± 0.0.6 and WD 0.03 ± 0.04). Significant improvements in alertness were observed using the KSS when comparing BL with FD and WD (6.3 ± 1.6, 4.9 ± 1.7, and 4.7 ± 1.7, respectively; p = 0.01). No changes in reaction time or SSS scores were noted.\n",

Of twenty-eight visual analogue scales rating mood and arousal, the subjects' ratings in the tyrosine treatment (9 g daily) and placebo periods differed significantly for only three (less tired, less drowsy, more alert). Ratings of daytime drowsiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, night-time sleep, overall clinical response, and measurements of multiple sleep latency and tests of speed and attention did not differ significantly between tyrosine and placebo periods. Dietary supplementation with tyrosine 9 g daily for 4 weeks seems to have a mild stimulant action on the central nervous system but this effect is not clinically significant in the treatment of the narcoleptic syndrome.Adult Affect / drug effects Arousal / drug effects Behavior / drug effects Cataplexy / drug therapy Double-Blind Method Drug Evaluation Female Humans Male Middle Aged Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Random Allocation Sleep, REM / drug effects Tyrosine / administration & dosage Tyrosine / therapeutic use*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

Major outcomes of these post hoc analyses, analyzed using analysis of covariance, were change from baseline in number of shifts from Stages N2/3/rapid eye movement (REM) to Stage N1/Wake, and from Stage N1/Wake to REM. Sleep quality was evaluated using the sleep-quality question from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.\n",
      "SXB alone or in combination with modafinil significantly decreased the number of shifts from Stage N2/3/REM to Stage N1/Wake (p < 0.01); least-squares mean change in number of shifts from baseline was -0.6, -16.5, 1.8, and -13.7 in the placebo, SXB, modafinil and SXB + modafinil groups, respectively. A similar pattern was observed for changes in shifts from REM to Stage N1/Wake and from Stage N1/Wake to REM. Relative to placebo, sleep quality significantly improved with SXB and SXB + modafinil (p ≤ 0.05) but not with modafinil alone.\n",

Sodium oxybate was administered as 6 g nightly for 4 weeks and was then increased to 9 g nightly for 4 additional weeks.

In contrast, the sodium-oxybate/modafinil group demonstrated an increase in daytime sleep latency from 10.43 minutes to 13.15 minutes (p < .001), suggesting that this combination of drugs produced an additive effect.

      "This is the first report describing the efficacy of modafinil therapy for narcolepsy in patients in Taiwan. The purpose of this study was to compare the objective Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and the subjective Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) for evaluating the efficacy of modafinil in treating excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy in Taiwan. Ten consecutive patients with narcolepsy-with-cataplexy who were treated with 200 mg/day modafinil for more than 6 months at our sleep center between January 2003 and December 2007 were included in this study. This comparative study was prompted by the requirement of the Bureau of National Health Insurance in Taiwan that modafinil users need to be followed up with MSLTs every 6-12 months. The mean age at onset of narcolepsy onset in these 10 patients was 11.8 +/- 3.3 years, and eight (80%) were male. We compared the differences in MSLT and ESS between baseline and follow-up at 6-12 months after starting modafinil therapy using paired t tests. ESS scores (p < 0.001) were considerably more sensitive than MSLT scores (p < 0.05) in documenting efficacy of modafinil and that the improvements in MSLT scores were minimal and remained in the pathologically sleepy range. These findings suggest that the ESS is a more sensitive and clinically meaningful tool to evaluate the efficacy of modafinil in narcolepsy.Adolescent Benzhydryl Compounds / administration & dosage* Child Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Male Modafinil Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Narcolepsy / physiopathology Polysomnography Sleep Stages Taiwan Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

Three studies employed the MSLT and 7 employed the MWT as their polygraphic measure of sleep tendency. Statistically and clinically significant therapeutic changes were apparent for pemoline, modafinil, dextroamphetamine and methylphenidate. Codeine, ritanserin and protriptyline did show statistically significant effects. The common feature among the drugs that did produce clinically significant improvements seems to be facilitatory action on central catecholaminergic transmission.

      "The narcoleptic syndrome is a life-long and sometimes familial disorder in which there is a disturbance of the rapid eye movement phase of sleep. Patients with periodic sleep in the daytime but no other symptoms seldom develop the narcoleptic syndrome and have a separate unrelated disorder. Twelve patients with the narcoleptic syndrome were treated separately with l(-) amphetamine and d(+) amphetamine. Both drugs abolished narcolepsy, d(+) amphetamine being slightly more potent than l(-) amphetamine. In equipotent doses, unwanted effects of nervousness and insomnia were equal in frequency. No tolerance to either preparation developed during a six month period. Cataplexy was not affected by amphetamine treatment, but was abolished in two patients when clomipramine was given together with either amphetamine.Adult Amphetamine / adverse effects Amphetamine / therapeutic use* Amphetamine / urine Antidepressive Agents / therapeutic use Cataplexy / drug therapy Dextroamphetamine / adverse effects Dextroamphetamine / therapeutic use* Dextroamphetamine / urine Electroencephalography Evaluation Studies as Topic Female Hallucinations / drug therapy Humans Isomerism Male Middle Aged Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Placebos Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders / chemically induced Sleep Stages Sleep Wake Disorders / drug therapy Sleep, REM / drug effects Sweating Tremor / chemically inducedQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "One hundred and forty patients (104 male and 36 female) aged 42.26 +/- 19.19 (range = 8 to 79.5 years) with narcolepsy-cataplexy were given modafinil (200 to 400 mg) at the Montpellier sleep disorders center from 1984 onwards. The follow-up focused on the reduction of excessive daytime somnolence (EDS), side effects and duration of treatment. In order to determine if any clinical aspect of narcolepsy could be involved in modafinil discontinuation, patients were divided into two groups according to continued or interrupted treatment. When modafinil effect on EDS was evaluated according to a scale varying from 0 (no effect) to 3 (excellent effect), 64.1% of the subjects, scored good or excellent. The mean duration of treatment was 22.05 months +/- 24.9, ranging from 1 to 114 months.

      "Narcolepsy is a central nervous system disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. This placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, 18-center study assessed the efficacy and safety of modafinil, a new wake-promoting drug for treating sleepiness in narcolepsy. Subjects with narcolepsy (n = 283) received daily modafinil, 200 or 400 mg, or placebo, for 9 weeks, followed by an open-label treatment period. Subjective sleepiness was measured with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Objective sleepiness was assessed with the Multiple Sleep Latency Test and the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test. Level of illness was measured with the Clinical Global Impression of Change. Modafinil significantly reduced all measures of sleepiness and was associated with significant improvements in level of illness. Medication-related adverse experiences were few, dose-dependent, and mostly rated mild to moderate. Modafinil taken once daily was a very well tolerated and effective wake-promoting agent in the treatment of excessive daytime somnolence associated with narcolepsy. Modafinil demonstrated an excellent safety profile for up to 40 weeks of open-label treatment and efficacy was maintained, suggesting that tolerance will not develop with long-term use. Modafinil is a pharmacologically and clinically promising compound for the treatment of pathological daytime somnolence.Adolescent Adult Aged Benzhydryl Compounds / adverse effects Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use* Central Nervous System Stimulants / adverse effects Central Nervous System Stimulants / therapeutic use* Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Double-Blind Method Female Humans Male Middle Aged Modafinil Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Narcolepsy / physiopathology* Reaction Time / drug effects Sleep Stages / drug effects* Treatment Outcome Wakefulness / drug effectsQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "The relative benefits of selegeline hydrochloride (2 x 5 mg, 2 x 10 mg selegeline) were studied in 30 narcoleptic patients using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Patients were randomly assigned to three groups (placebo and 2 x 5 mg and 2 x 10 mg selegeline). After a 2-week washout period for previous anticataplectic and stimulant medication, the study started with a 2-day period of placebo intake for each group, continued by 14 days of medication, ending with a 2-day placebo period. Outcome was measured by comparison of four polysomnographies and four multiple sleep latency tests (MSLTs) performed during the initial and the final placebo and medication period. Each MSLT day included acoustic and visual vigilance tests. Blood pressure and pulse rate were monitored daily. Patients reported daily about mood, concentration, subjective sleep time, nocturnal awakenings, nocturnal wake times, number of naps, and occurrence of symptoms of the narcoleptic tetrad. Selegeline caused dose-dependent REM suppression during nighttime sleep and naps and increase of sleep and REM latency. Under selegeline, daytime sleepiness improved significantly and the number of sleep attacks and naps as well as the frequency of cataplexy were reduced. Selegeline at a dose of a least 20 mg/day is a potent drug for the treatment of all narcoleptic symptoms.Adolescent Adult Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Double-Blind Method Female Humans Male Middle Aged Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Polysomnography Reaction Time / physiology Selegiline / therapeutic use* Sleep, REM / drug effectsQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "In evaluating pathologic sleepiness, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) assesses subjective sleep propensity; the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) is an objective measure of the ability to stay awake. This analysis evaluated the strength of the correlation between ESS and MWT with regard to absolute values in scores.\n",
      "Data were analyzed separately from the intent-to-treat populations of two eight-week clinical trials of sodium oxybate for the treatment of narcolepsy, SXB-15 and SXB-22. For all treatment groups, correlations between ESS and MWT were evaluated at baseline, week four, and week eight using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient.\n",
      "Overall, correlations across all treatment groups in each study described an inverse relationship, reflecting the scoring of each measure (ie, whereas higher ESS scores indicate greater sleepiness, higher MWT scores indicate a greater ability to remain awake). Significant correlations of low-to-moderate strength were observed at all time points in both studies. In SXB-15, correlation coefficients were -0.272, -0.365, and -0.343 at baseline (n = 221), week four (n = 212), and week eight (n = 205), respectively, with all P < 0.0001. Similarly, in SXB-22, correlation coefficients were -0.302 (n = 216), -0.418 (n = 211), and -0.432 (n = 196) at the three time points, respectively, also with all P < 0.0001.\n",
      "Although all correlations showed statistical significance, they were of low-to-moderate strength. These results indicate that ESS and MWT measure features of pathologic sleepiness that may be distinct, but partially overlapping. These data corroborate those of other studies, suggesting that physiologic mechanisms that regulate alertness and sleep propensity may function somewhat independently.Adolescent Adult Aged Humans Middle Aged Narcolepsy / diagnosis* Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Patient Reported Outcome Measures Sleep / drug effects Sodium Oxybate / therapeutic use* Treatment Outcome Wakefulness / drug effects* Wakefulness-Promoting Agents / therapeutic use* Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

SXB was initiated at 6 g for weeks 1-4 and increased to 9 g for weeks 5-8. TEAEs reported more frequently in SXB-treated participants than placebo and in ≥5% of any SXB treatment group during week 1 were examined as TEAEs of interest.\n",
      "Dizziness and nausea met criteria as TEAEs of interest in both studies; headache also met criteria as a TEAE of interest in SXB-15. Incidence of new or worsened TEAEs was highest at week 1 (SXB-15: dizziness, 7.5%; headache, 7.5%; nausea, 5.9%; SXB-22: dizziness, 5.4%; nausea, 7.1%) and decreased over time in both studies. The longest median duration was reported for dizziness: 9.0 and 17.5 days in SXB-15 and SXB-22, respectively.

      "A modafinil daily dosing strategy promotes wakefulness in narcolepsy patients experiencing excessive daytime sleepiness; however, some patients may continue to experience late-day sleepiness. Excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy is associated with cognitive impairment. Modafinil has improved executive function in other models of excessive sleepiness. This study evaluated the effects of once-daily vs. split doses of modafinil on wakefulness and of combined doses on executive function in narcolepsy patients experiencing late-day sleepiness despite satisfactory modafinil treatment earlier in the day.\n",

Assessments included a Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) for individual regimens and the Wisconsin Card Sort Test (WCST) for treatments combined.\n",
      "Modafinil 600-mg split dose was significantly more effective than modafinil 400-mg once daily in improving late-day MWT scores (5 PM-7 PM; P < 0.05).

      "The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of EEG mapping as an objective and quantitative measure of vigilance in untreated and modafinil-treated narcoleptics, and compare it with the conventional neurophysiological method of the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and the subjective Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). In 16 drug-free narcoleptics and 16 normal controls a baseline 3-min vigilance-controlled EEG (V-EEG) and a 4-min resting EEG (R-EEG) were recorded during midmorning hours. Thereafter, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, patients were treated with a 3-week fixed titration of modafinil (200, 300, 400 mg) and placebo. EEG-mapping, MSLT and ESS measures were obtained before and at the end of the third week of therapy. Statistical overall analysis by means of the omnibus significance test demonstrated significant EEG differences between untreated patients and controls in the resting condition only (R-EEG). Subsequent univariate analysis revealed an increase in absolute and relative theta power, a decrease in alpha-2 and beta power as well as a slowing of the dominant frequency and the centroids of the alpha, beta and total power spectrum and thus objectified a vigilance decrement in narcolepsy. Modafinil 400 mg/d significantly improved vigilance as compared with placebo (p < or = 0.01), inducing changes opposite to the aforementioned baseline differences (key-lock principle). The MSLT and the ESS also improved under modafinil as compared with placebo, but changes were less consistent. Spearman rank correlations revealed the highest correlations between EEG mapping and the ESS, followed by those between EEG mapping and the MSLT, while the lowest correlation was found between the MSLT and the ESS. In conclusion, EEG mapping is a valuable instrument for measuring vigilance decrements in narcolepsy and their improvement under psychostimulant treatment.Adult Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use* Brain Mapping* Case-Control Studies Double-Blind Method Electroencephalography / drug effects* Evaluation Studies as Topic Female Humans Male Middle Aged Modafinil Multivariate Analysis Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Narcolepsy / physiopathology Neuroprotective Agents / therapeutic use* Neuropsychological Tests / statistics & numerical data Placebos Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Reaction Time / drug effects Statistics, Nonparametric Surveys and Questionnaires Treatment OutcomeQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "To compare maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) data gathered at baseline in the course of two, multicenter studies on the therapeutic efficacy of modafinil with published MWT norms.\n",
      "The MWT is a procedure that uses electrophysiological measures to determine the ability to remain awake while sitting in a quiet, darkened room. The test consists of 4 20 min trials conducted 4 times at 2 h intervals commencing 2 h after awakening from a night of sleep. MWT data were gathered at baseline in the course of two, multicenter studies on the therapeutic efficacy of modafinil. Subjects were 17-68 year old men (n = 239) and women (n = 291) diagnosed with narcolepsy according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD). All patients were free of psychoactive medication for a minimum of 14 days.\n",
      "Mean MWT sleep latency was 6.0 +/- 4.8 min. However, the mean for the first MWT trial was 7.0 min which was longer that the means for the following 3 trials (5.8, 5.6 and 5.7 min, respectively). The 4 distributions of the individual MWT trials were similar and adequately summarized by the distribution of the average MWT sleep latency. As a group, patients with narcolepsy were less able to remain awake than normals; only 8 of 530 (1.5%) patients were able to remain awake on 4 20 min MWT trials compared with 35 of 64 (54.7%) normals in another study. However, using a mean MWT sleep latency of 12 min (the 5th percentile for normals) as the lowest cut-point for normalcy, 15% of patients with narcolepsy appeared to have an unimpaired ability to remain awake.\n",
      "The diagnosis of narcolepsy did not always predict inability to remain awake on the MWT. Age, gender and the duration of illness did not predict ability to remain awake. Patients with severe cataplexy and other ancillary symptoms were least able to remain awake on MWT trials. Patients who used tobacco and caffeine moderately had the lowest MWT sleep latencies relative to patients with heavy and light use.Adolescent Adult Aged Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use Central Nervous System Stimulants / therapeutic use Data Interpretation, Statistical Female Humans Male Middle Aged Modafinil Narcolepsy / drug therapy Narcolepsy / physiopathology* Polysomnography Predictive Value of Tests Sleep* Wakefulness*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study the authors compared the efficacy of modafinil 400 mg once daily, 400 mg given in a split dose, or 200 mg once daily for maintaining wakefulness throughout the day in patients (N = 32) with narcolepsy reporting a positive daytime response to modafinil but late-afternoon/evening sleepiness. Efficacy evaluations included an extended Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (9:00 am to 9:00 pm), the Clinical Global Impression of Change scale, and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Modafinil demonstrated significant improvement in wakefulness as assessed by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale compared with placebo at baseline (all P < 0.001). Modafinil significantly improved patients' ability to sustain wakefulness, as demonstrated by mean sleep latency at week 3 compared with placebo at baseline (all P < 0.001). The 400-mg split-dose regimen improved wakefulness significantly in the evening compared with the 200-mg and 400-mg once-daily regimen (both P < 0.05). The percentage of patients rated as \"much improved\" or \"very much improved\" with respect to evening sleepiness was 27%, 82%, and 80% in the 200-mg, 400-mg once-daily, and 400-mg split-dose groups, respectively. Adverse events were mild to moderate in nature and included headache, nausea, nervousness, dyspepsia, pain, and vomiting (all 6%). Some patients may benefit from 400-mg doses of modafinil taken once daily compared with 200-mg doses. A split-dose 400-mg regimen may be superior to once-daily dosing for sustaining wakefulness throughout the entire waking day.Adult Aged Analysis of Variance Benzhydryl Compounds / administration & dosage* Circadian Rhythm / drug effects* Circadian Rhythm / physiology Cross-Over Studies Double-Blind Method Drug Administration Schedule Female Humans Male Middle Aged Modafinil Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Narcolepsy / physiopathology Single-Blind Method Wakefulness / drug effects* Wakefulness / physiologyQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Seventy-five patients meeting international diagnostic criteria for narcolepsy enrolled in a 6-week, three-period, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled trial. Patients received placebo, modafinil 200 mg, or modafinil 400 mg in divided doses (morning and noon). Evaluations occurred at baseline and at the end of each 2-week period. Compared with placebo, modafinil 200 and 400 mg significantly increased the mean sleep latency on the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test by 40% and 54%, with no significant difference between the two doses. Modafinil, 200 and 400 mg, also reduced the combined number of daytime sleep episodes and periods of severe sleepiness noted in sleep logs. The likelihood of falling asleep as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale was equally reduced by both modafinil dose levels. There were no effects on nocturnal sleep initiation, maintenance, or architecture, nor were there any effects on sleep apnea or periodic leg movements. Neither dose interfered with the patients' ability to nap voluntarily during the day nor with their quantity or quality of nocturnal sleep. Modafinil produced no changes in blood pressure or heart rate in either normotensive or hypertensive patients. The only significant adverse effects were seen at the 400-mg dose, which was associated with more nausea and more nervousness than either placebo or the 200-mg dose. As little as a 200-mg daily dose of modafinil is therefore an effective and well-tolerated treatment of excessive daytime somnolence in narcoleptic persons.Adult Benzhydryl Compounds / administration & dosage Benzhydryl Compounds / adverse effects Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use* Central Nervous System Stimulants / adverse effects Central Nervous System Stimulants / therapeutic use* Circadian Rhythm* Cross-Over Studies Double-Blind Method Drug Administration Schedule Female Humans Male Middle Aged Modafinil Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Narcolepsy / physiopathology* Placebos Reaction Time Sleep / physiology Sleep Stages* Treatment Outcome WakefulnessQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Recovery from general anesthesia often involves residual sedation, drowsiness, fatigue, and lack of energy that may last hours to days. Modafinil is a wakefulness-promoting drug approved for patients with excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. We evaluated the effect of single doses of modafinil (200 mg) and placebo in patients recovering from general anesthesia. Thirty-four subjects participated in this prospective, randomized, double-blind study approved by our IRB. Preoperatively, patients were asked to rate various symptoms they had experienced over the previous 24-h using a verbal analog scale (VAS) of 0 to 10 as well as discrete scale when indicated. Postoperatively, once the patient was able to tolerate oral intake and met our institutional discharge criteria, the study drug (modafinil 200 mg or placebo) was administered with a sip of water. Patients were contacted 24 (1) hours after dosing to evaluate postdischarge symptoms. Patients in the placebo group reported significantly more postoperative fatigue (4.8 [3.3] versus 1.4 [1.8]), exhaustion (4.3 [3.3] versus 2.4 [3.1]), or degree of feeling worn out (4.7 [3.6] versus 2.9 [2.4]). Significantly more patients reported moderate to severe fatigue in the placebo group (65% versus 12%). Two major themes of \"alertness\" and \"energy\" were expressed by 71% of the patients receiving modafinil versus 18% of those receiving placebo. Patients recovering from general anesthesia can significantly benefit from modafinil.\n",

      "This is one of two separate clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of modafinil, a novel wake-promoting agent, in patients with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) associated with narcolepsy.\n",
      "In this 9-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 21-center clinical trial, patients were randomized to receive fixed daily doses of modafinil 200 mg, modafinil 400 mg, or placebo. A placebo-controlled, 2-week treatment discontinuation phase was included to evaluate the effects of withdrawal on patients who had been receiving modafinil. A total of 271 patients who were naive to modafinil received study medication in the 9-week trial and 240 patients received study medication in the discontinuation phase.\n",
      "Treatment with modafinil resulted in significant improvement in two objective measures of EDS: the Multiple Sleep Latency Test and the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test. Additionally, patient self-assessment of sleepiness was significantly improved, as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and level of illness was significantly reduced on the independent clinician assessment, the Clinical Global Impression of Change. Nighttime sleep, monitored by nocturnal polysomnography, was not adversely effected with modafinil treatment compared with placebo treatment. The most frequent adverse experience was headache, which was not significantly greater for modafinil than placebo. During treatment discontinuation, individuals who had been receiving modafinil experienced a return of their EDS to baseline levels. During treatment discontinuation, patients did not experience symptoms associated with amphetamine withdrawal syndrome. For up to 9 weeks of daily use there was no evidence for the development of dependence at the dose levels studied.\n",
      "The data indicate that modafinil has an excellent safety profile and is very well tolerated. Modafinil is an effective treatment for excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy and shows continued efficacy with up to 9 weeks of daily use.Adolescent Adult Aged Benzhydryl Compounds / adverse effects Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use* Double-Blind Method Female Humans Male Middle Aged Modafinil Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Narcolepsy / physiopathology* Polysomnography Reaction Time / physiology Sleep / drug effects Sleep / physiology* Wakefulness / physiologyQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Disease symptoms and adverse events were recorded in daily diaries. The primary measure of efficacy was the change from baseline in weekly cataplexy attacks. Secondary measures included daytime sleepiness using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), inadvertent daytime naps/sleep attacks and nighttime awakenings. Investigators assessed changes in disease severity using Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-c). Compared to placebo, weekly cataplexy attacks were decreased by sodium oxybate at the 6 g dose (p=0.0529) and significantly at the 9 g dose (p=0.0008). The ESS was reduced at all doses, becoming significant at the 9 g dose (p=0.0001). The CGI-c demonstrated a dose-related improvement, significant at the 9 g dose (p=0.0002). The frequency of inadvertent naps/sleep attacks and the nighttime awakenings showed similar dose-response trends, becoming significant at the 9 g dose (p=0.0122 and p=0.0035, respectively).

      "The aim of the present study was to identify brain regions associated with vigilance in untreated and modafinil-treated narcoleptic patients by means of low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). 16 drug-free narcoleptics and 16 normal controls were included in the baseline investigation. Subsequently patients participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study receiving a three-week fixed titration of modafinil (200, 300, 400 mg) and placebo. Measurements comprised LORETA, the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) obtained before and after three weeks' therapy. Statistical overall analysis by means of the omnibus significance test demonstrated significant inter-group differences in the resting (R-EEG), but not in the vigilance-controlled recordings (V-EEG). Subsequent univariate analysis revealed a decrease in alpha-2 and beta 1-3 power in prefrontal, temporal and parietal cortices, with the right hemisphere slightly more involved in this vigilance decrement. Modafinil 400 mg/d as compared with placebo induced changes opposite to the aforementioned baseline differences (key-lock principle) with a preponderance in the left hemisphere. This increase in vigilance resulted in an improvement in the MSLT and the ESS. LORETA provided evidence of a functional deterioration of the fronto-temporo-parietal network of the right-hemispheric vigilance system in narcolepsy and a therapeutic effect of modafinil on the left hemisphere, which is less affected by the disease.Adult Arousal / drug effects* Benzhydryl Compounds / pharmacology Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use* Brain Mapping Double-Blind Method Drug Administration Schedule Electroencephalography / drug effects* Electromagnetic Phenomena / methods* Female Functional Laterality Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging / methods Male Middle Aged Modafinil Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Narcolepsy / physiopathology Neuroprotective Agents / pharmacology Neuroprotective Agents / therapeutic use* Placebos Polysomnography / methodsQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "We conducted a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study in 20 patients with TBI who had fatigue or EDS or both. After baseline examinations (questionnaires including the Epworth Sleepiness Scale to assess EDS and the Fatigue Severity Scale to assess fatigue, actigraphy, polysomnography, maintenance of wakefulness test, and psychomotor vigilance test), 10 patients received 100 to 200 mg modafinil every morning, and 10 patients were treated with placebo.

      "Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder associated with HLA DR15 (DR2) and DQB1*0602. We HLA typed 509 patients enrolled in a clinical trial for the drug modafinil and analyzed the results in relation to cataplexy, a symptom of narcolepsy characterized by muscle weakness triggered by emotions. The patients were either subjects with cataplexy who had a mean sleep latency (SL) of less than 8 minutes and two or more sleep onset rapid eye movement (REM) periods (SOREMPs) during a multiple sleep latency test, or narcoleptic patients without cataplexy but with a mean SL shorter than 5 minutes and two or more SOREMPs. The respective values of DRB1*15 (DR2) and DQB1*0602 as markers for narcolepsy were first compared in different ethnic groups and in patients with and without cataplexy. DQB1*0602 was found to be a more sensitive marker for narcolepsy than DRB1*15 across all ethnic groups. DQB1*0602 frequency was strikingly higher in patients with cataplexy versus patients without cataplexy (76.1% in 421 patients versus 40.9% in 88 patients). Positivity was highest in patients with severe cataplexy (94.8%) and progressively decreased to 54.2% in patients with the mildest cataplexy. A voluntary 50-item questionnaire focusing on cataplexy was also analyzed in 212 of the 509 HLA-typed patients. Subjects with definite cataplexy as observed by an experienced clinician were more frequently HLA DQB1*0602-positive than those with doubtful cataplexy, and the manifestations of cataplexy were clinically more typical in DQB1*0602-positive patients. These results show that the HLA association is as tight as previously reported (85-95%) when cataplexy is clinically typical or severe. We also found that patients with mild, atypical, or no cataplexy have a significantly increased DQB1*0602 frequency (40-60%) in comparison with ethnically matched controls (24%). These results could be explained by increased disease heterogeneity in the noncataplexy group or by a direct effect of the HLA DQB1*0602 genotype on the clinical expression of narcolepsy.Adolescent Adult Aged Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use Cataplexy / drug therapy Cataplexy / etiology Cataplexy / immunology* Central Nervous System Stimulants / therapeutic use Female HLA-DQ Antigens / immunology* Haplotypes / genetics Humans Male Middle Aged Modafinil Narcolepsy / complications Narcolepsy / immunology* Racial Groups Severity of Illness Index Sleep, REM / physiologyQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Few treatments are available for patients with idiopathic hypersomnia (IH). Modafinil, an established treatment for narcolepsy, was tested for efficacy and safety in Japanese patients with IH without long sleep time.\n",
      "This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group comparison study was conducted at 20 institutions in Japan. Patients who met the diagnostic criteria of IH in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (second edition) were included. The study comprised a ≥17-day observation period and a 3-week treatment period during which modafinil (200 mg) or placebo was administered orally once daily (in the morning). The primary efficacy endpoint was change in mean sleep latency on the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT). Adverse events (AEs) were also recorded to evaluate safety.\n",
      "In total, 123 patients were screened and 71 were randomized to receive modafinil (N = 34) or placebo (N = 37). Patients treated with modafinil experienced a significantly prolonged mean sleep latency on the MWT at the end of the study compared with placebo (5.02 min, 95% confidence interval: 3.26-6.77 min; p < 0.001). AEs occurred in 58.8% (20/34) and 27.0% (10/37) of patients in the modafinil and placebo groups, respectively. Frequent AEs in the modafinil group were headache (n = 6), dry mouth (n = 3), and nausea (n = 3); no clinically significant AEs occurred.\n",

      "The stimulant modafinil has proved to be an effective treatment modality for narcolepsy and related sleep disorders and is also being studied for use during sustained military operations to ameliorate the effects of fatigue due to sleep loss. However, a previous study reported that a relatively large, single dose of modafinil (300 mg), administered to already sleep-deprived individuals, caused participants to overestimate their cognitive abilities (i.e. 'overconfidence'). Because the predominant application of modafinil is in otherwise healthy, non-sleep-deprived individuals, the present study investigated the generality of modafinil-induced overconfidence in a group of 18 healthy, non sleep-deprived adults. The design involved a double-blind, placebo controlled, fully within-subjects manipulation of placebo and modafinil (4 mg/kg: approximately 300 mg, on average) over three 50-min cognitive testing sessions (i.e. before drug ingestion, and at 90 and 180 min after drug ingestion). The cognitive task battery included subjective assessments of mood, fatigue, affect, vigor and motivation, and cognitive assessments of serial reaction time, logical reasoning, visual comparison, mental addition and vigilance. In addition, trial-by-trial confidence judgements were obtained for two of the cognitive tasks and more global, task level assessments of performance were obtained for four of the cognitive tasks. Relative to placebo, modafinil improved fatigue levels, motivation, reaction time and vigilance. In terms of self-assessments of cognitive performance, both the placebo and modafinil conditions were 'well calibrated' on trial-by-trial confidence judgements, showing neither marked over- nor under-confidence. Of note, the modafinil condition displayed a non-significant tendency towards 'overconfidence' for task-level assessments of performance. The present findings highlight the need for continued research on the many complex interactions involving fatigue states, occasional versus long-term stimulant use, and subjective assessments of fatigue and cognitive performance.Adolescent Adult Benzhydryl Compounds / pharmacology* Central Nervous System Stimulants / pharmacology* Cognition / drug effects* Double-Blind Method Fatigue / psychology Humans Male Modafinil Reaction Time / drug effects Surveys and Questionnaires Visual Perception / drug effectsQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Modafinil, a medication for the excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy, has been hypothesized to improve not just alertness but mood as well. The purpose of this study was to determine how treatment with modafinil affects mood in healthy volunteers. Normal healthy volunteers (n = 12, 10 men and 2 women; 30-44 years) underwent a 3-day, counterbalanced, randomized, crossover, inpatient trial of modafinil (400 mg daily) versus placebo with 4-day washout period between 2 treatments. Mood was assessed daily using both the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and a general mood scale, which consisted of 10 bipolar adjective ratings based on a severity scale ranging from 1 to 10. Modafinil increased general mood and Negative Affect scales relative to placebo and had a significant effect on Positive Affect scales. These results suggest that modafinil may have general mood-elevating effects accompanied by increased negative affect (anxiety). The findings may have implications for clinical practice, in particular for the adjunctive use of modafinil in treatment-resistant depression.Administration, Oral Adult Affect / drug effects* Benzhydryl Compounds / administration & dosage Benzhydryl Compounds / pharmacology* Central Nervous System Stimulants / administration & dosage Central Nervous System Stimulants / pharmacology* Cross-Over Studies Double-Blind Method Female Hospitalization Humans Male Modafinil Reference ValuesQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Sodium oxybate (SXB) is an approved drug for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and cataplexy in narcolepsy. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a condition that frequently co-occurs with narcolepsy. Given the known central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects of SXB, this study aimed to examine its effects on sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and sleep architecture in patients with OSAS.\n",
      "Sixty patients with a history of mild to moderate OSAS (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI]>or=10 and <or=40, mean oxygen saturation [SaO(2)] >or=75%) received one of four treatments of the following: (1) 9g SXB, (2) 9g SXB/modafinil 200mg, (3) zolpidem 10mg, and (4) placebo (PBO) in a randomized, crossover design on four consecutive nights followed by overnight polysomnography.\n",
      "Forty-two patients (70%) completed the study. The mean change from baseline in AHI and mean SaO(2) was not significantly different among groups following treatment. Central apneas in patients treated with SXB increased, and clinically significant oxygen desaturations were seen in three patients with SXB treatment. The most common treatment related adverse events were headache and nausea.\n",

      "To investigate the effects of a wake-promoting drug, modafinil on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in healthy volunteers, we performed (99m)Tc-ethylcysteinate dimer single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) before and after modafinil or placebo administration. Twenty-one healthy subjects received single doses of 400 mg modafinil or placebo in a double blind randomized crossover study design. Administrations of modafinil or placebo in a subject were separated by a 2-week washout. Brain SPECT was performed twice before and 3 h after modafinil or placebo administration. For statistical parametric mapping analysis, all SPECT images were spatially normalized to the standard SPECT template and then smoothed using a 12-mm full width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel. The paired t-test was used to compare pre- versus post-modafinil and pre- versus post-placebo SPECT images. Differences in rCBF between post-modafinil and post-placebo conditions were also tested. Modafinil decreased Epworth and Stanford sleepiness scales whereas placebo did not. The post-modafinil condition was associated with increased rCBF in bilateral thalami and dorsal pons, whereas the post-placebo condition showed increased rCBF in a smaller area of the dorsal pons when compared with the drug naïve baseline condition. Compared with the post-placebo condition, the post-modafinil condition showed higher rCBF in bilateral frontopolar, orbitofrontal, superior frontal, middle frontal gyri, short insular gyri, left cingulate gyrus, left middle/inferior temporal gyri, left parahippocampal gyrus, and left pons. In healthy volunteers, modafinil increased wakefulness and rCBF in the arousal-related systems and in brain areas related to emotion and executive function.Acoustic Stimulation Adult Benzhydryl Compounds / pharmacology Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use* Brain / blood supply* Brain / diagnostic imaging Brain / metabolism Central Nervous System Stimulants / pharmacology Central Nervous System Stimulants / therapeutic use* Cerebrovascular Circulation / drug effects* Cerebrovascular Circulation / physiology Cross-Over Studies Disorders of Excessive Somnolence / diagnosis Disorders of Excessive Somnolence / drug therapy Disorders of Excessive Somnolence / epidemiology Double-Blind Method Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe / diagnostic imaging Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe / metabolism Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe / physiopathology Female Glucose / metabolism Humans Limbic System / blood supply Limbic System / diagnostic imaging Limbic System / metabolism Male Modafinil Narcolepsy / diagnostic imaging Narcolepsy / drug therapy Narcolepsy / metabolism Photic Stimulation Reaction Time / drug effects Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon Wakefulness / drug effects*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Modafinil is a medication licensed for the treatment of narcolepsy. However, it has been reported that healthy individuals without wakefulness disorders are using modafinil off-label to enhance cognitive functioning. Although some studies have reported that modafinil improves cognitive task performance in healthy volunteers, numerous other studies have failed to detect cognitive enhancing effects of modafinil on several well-established neuropsychological tasks. Interestingly, several clinical and preclinical studies have found that improved cognitive task performance by modafinil is accompanied by slower response times. This observation raises the question as to whether this slowing of response time in healthy volunteers is a necessary and sufficient condition for cognitive enhancement with modafinil. The aim of the current experiment was to explore this question by investigating the effects of modafinil on the Hayling Sentence Completion Test (HSCT).\n",
      "Sixty-four healthy volunteers received either a single dose (200 mg) of modafinil (n = 32) or placebo (n = 32) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in which the principal outcome measures were response latencies on the response initiation and response inhibition sections of the HSCT.\n",
      "Participants dosed with modafinil had significantly longer mean response latencies on the HSCT for both the response initiation and response inhibition compared to participants dosed with placebo. However, participants in both groups made a similar number of errors on each of these measures, indicating that modafinil did not enhance the accuracy of performance of the task relative to placebo.\n",
      "This study demonstrated that administration of single 200 mg doses of modafinil to healthy individuals increased the latency of responses in the performance of the HSCT, a task that is highly sensitive to prefrontal executive function, without enhancing accuracy of performance. This finding may provide important clues to defining the limitations of modafinil as a putative cognitive enhancer.\n",

      "To assess the efficacy and safety of modafinil for improving wakefulness in narcolepsy patients treated previously with psychostimulants.\n",
      "Modafinil has become a standard therapy for improving daytime wakefulness in narcolepsy patients and may be a useful therapeutic alternative to psychostimulants used to improve waking function in other medical conditions. Modafinil is chemically dissimilar to and has a pharmacological profile that differs from the psychostimulants. Modafinil has a low abuse potential and is well tolerated.\n",
      "Patients (N=151) with narcolepsy who had been unsatisfactorily treated with dextroamphetamine (N=48), methylphenidate (N=66), or pemoline (N=37) were enrolled in this 6-week, open-label, multicenter study. Following a 2-week washout period, patients received modafinil once daily (Week 1, 200 mg; Weeks 2-6, 200 or 400 mg). Efficacy was evaluated at Weeks 1, 2, and 6 using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the Clinical Global Impression of Change. Adverse events were monitored throughout the study.\n",
      "Treatment with modafinil improved daytime wakefulness versus baseline regardless of which psychostimulant was taken previously. Mean ESS scores were improved after 1 week of treatment with modafinil. Improvements were maintained throughout the 6 weeks of treatment (all P<0.001 versus baseline after washout). At Week 6, 79% of all patients were considered to be clinically improved relative to post-washout baseline. The most frequent adverse events were headache, nausea, and insomnia; the majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in nature. Approximately 70% of patients were receiving 400 mg of modafinil once daily at the end of the study.\n",

      "Modafinil is a wake-promoting agent approved by the Federal Drug Administration for the treatment of narcolepsy. Preliminary evidence indicates that modafinil may improve fatigue and excessive sleepiness associated with a variety of conditions. The purpose of this study was to investigate the utility of modafinil as an adjunctive treatment of depressed patients. Subjects with a history of major depression with partial response on a stable therapeutic dose of an antidepressant were eligible to participate. All subjects endorsed complaints of significant fatigue and/or excessive sleepiness on clinical assessment. Modafinil was added to their existing regimen at a dose of 100 to 400 mg/d for 4 weeks. Subjects were assessed at 2-week intervals for improvement using the standard depression scales (HDRS, BDI, CGI), fatigue scales (VASF, FSI), and a neuropsychologic battery. Thirty-five subjects were entered and 31 subjects completed the 4-week trial. Significant improvements were seen across all 3 measures of depression (HDRS, BDI, CGIS) and both measures of fatigue (VASF, FSI). On the neurocognitive battery, significant gains in the Stroop Interference Test were seen at 4 weeks, whereas the other cognitive tests showed no change. Modafinil may be a useful and a well-tolerated adjunctive agent to standard antidepressants in the treatment of major depression.Adult Aged Antidepressive Agents / pharmacology Antidepressive Agents / therapeutic use Benzhydryl Compounds / pharmacology Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use* Depressive Disorder, Major / diagnosis Depressive Disorder, Major / drug therapy* Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Disorders of Excessive Somnolence / drug therapy Double-Blind Method Drug Administration Schedule Drug Therapy, Combination* Drug Tolerance Fatigue / drug therapy Female Humans Male Middle Aged Modafinil Prospective Studies* Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Time Factors Treatment OutcomeQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Modafinil, a novel stimulant, is effective in the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. It is biochemically and pharmacologically distinct from prototypical stimulants such as D-amphetamine, cocaine, and methylphenidate. The present experiment was designed to assess the acute behavioral effects of oral modafinil, cocaine, and placebo in participants (n=9) with recent histories of cocaine use (i.e. positive urine for cocaine or benzoylecgonine during the initial screening interview). Drug effects were assessed with a battery of self-reported drug-effect questionnaires, performance measures, and physiological indices. Cocaine, but not modafinil, produced stimulant-like self-reported drug effects (e.g. increased ratings of High and Stimulated). Modafinil and cocaine dose-dependently increased heart rate and blood pressure. The results of the present study suggest that modafinil has minimal abuse potential, but should be viewed cautiously because of the relatively small sample size. Future studies should further characterize the abuse potential of modafinil using other behavioral arrangements, such as drug discrimination or drug self-administration. A full characterization of the abuse potential of modafinil will become important as the use of this drug increases.Adult Behavior / drug effects* Benzhydryl Compounds / pharmacology* Blood Pressure / drug effects Central Nervous System Stimulants / pharmacology* Cocaine-Related Disorders / physiopathology Cocaine-Related Disorders / psychology Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Euphoria / drug effects Female Heart Rate / drug effects Humans Male Middle Aged Modafinil Psychomotor Performance / drug effects Substance-Related Disorders / physiopathology* Substance-Related Disorders / psychology* Surveys and QuestionnairesQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Modafinil is a novel compound that is approved for the treatment of narcolepsy. It is now being studied as a potential treatment for cocaine dependence. Cocaine withdrawal symptoms are associated with poor clinical outcome and are likely to be reversed by modafinil. In addition, the neurotransmitter actions of modafinil are opposite to cocaine-induced neuroadaptations affecting dopamine and glutamate reward circuits. Since cocaine-dependent subjects might use cocaine during a clinical trial with modafinil, this study tested the safety of intravenous cocaine (30 mg) in combination with modafinil. Each of seven subjects received a baseline (open-label) cocaine infusion. Three subsequent cocaine infusions were administered after subjects received 4 days of low dose modafinil (200 mg/day), high dose modafinil (400 mg/day), or placebo in randomized double-blind sequences. One subject received placebo prior to all infusions. Our results indicate that co-administering modafinil and a single dose of intravenous cocaine is not associated with medical risk in terms of blood pressure, pulse, temperature, or electrocardiogram measures. Furthermore, pretreatment with modafinil did not intensify cocaine euphoria or cocaine-induced craving. In fact, cocaine euphoria was significantly blunted (P=0.02) in one of our subjective measures.Adult Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use* Blood Pressure / drug effects Body Temperature / drug effects Central Nervous System Stimulants / therapeutic use* Cocaine / adverse effects* Cocaine / pharmacokinetics Cocaine-Related Disorders / drug therapy* Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Double-Blind Method Drug Interactions Humans Male Middle Aged Modafinil PulseQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Modafinil is a well-tolerated psychostimulant drug with low addictive potential that is used to treat patients with narcolepsy or attention deficit disorders and to enhance vigilance in sleep-deprived military personal. So far, understanding of the cognitive enhancing effects of modafinil and the relevant neurobiological mechanisms are incomplete.\n",
      "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of modafinil on working memory processes in humans and how they are related to noradrenergic stimulation of the prefrontal cortex.\n",
      "Sixteen healthy volunteers (aged 20-29 years) received either modafinil 200 mg or placebo using a double blind crossover design. Two computerized working memory tasks were administered, a numeric manipulation task that requires short-term maintenance of digit-sequences and different degrees of manipulation as well as delayed matching task that assesses maintenance of visuo-spatial information over varying delay lengths. The battery was supplemented by standardized paper pencil tasks of attentional functions.\n",
      "Modafinil significantly reduced error rates in the long delay condition of the visuo-spatial task and in the manipulation conditions, but not in the maintenance condition of the numeric task. Analyses of reaction times showed no speed-accuracy trade-off. Attentional control tasks (letter cancellation, trail-making, catch trials) were not affected by modafinil.\n",

      "Interpretation of drug testing results requires detailed scientific information, particularly in those cases where the question of legitimate use versus illicit use arises. Amphetamine remains a widely abused drug throughout the world, although it is also used therapeutically for weight loss, narcolepsy, and attention-deficit disorder with hyperactivity (ADHD). Treatment of ADHD using stimulant drugs is much more common now than it was in even the recent past. Increasingly, older individuals are diagnosed and treated for ADHD, and treatment often continues into adulthood. Amphetamine is commonly used for the treatment of ADHD and is available by prescription as either the d-enantiomer or a mixture of enantiomers. Although used for many years, there are no data available to describe the excretion profile of amphetamine and its enantiomers following repeated use of the drug. As a result, medical review officers (MROs) and forensic toxicologists have no direct evidence to base their decisions on when it comes to evaluation of use of these drugs. The current study was designed to determine the concentration and enantiomer excretion profile following repeated daily administration of mixed enantiomers of amphetamine. Twenty milligrams of Adderall was administered daily to five healthy subjects with all subsequent ad lib urine samples collected for at least five days following administration of the five-dose regimen. Adderall is a 3:1 mixture of d- and l-enantiomers of amphetamine salts and represents the mixed enantiomer proportion of amphetamine available in the United States through pharmaceutical channels. Peak amphetamine concentrations ranged from 5739 to 19,172 ng/mL. Samples containing > or = 500 ng/mL amphetamine (the administrative cutoff for a positive result by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) were seen up to 60:15 (h:min) following administration of the last dose. Enantiomer analysis showed the d-enantiomer to be in excess of the l-enantiomer for as long as the drug was administered. After administration of the last dose of drug, the proportion of l-enantiomer increased over time. Not all samples that contained > or = 500 ng/mL total amphetamine were positive when tested by immunoassay because of the differing cross-reactivity of the enantiomers. This study provides the first description of the excretion of amphetamine following repeated administration of Adderall. The presence of the l-enantiomer separates this drug from other formulations composed of only the d-enantiomer (i.e., Dexedrine and much illicit amphetamine), thus readily differentiating them from Adderall use. Some illicit and medicinal amphetamine is, however, a mixture of amphetamine enantiomers. Because the enantiomers are metabolized at different rates, their proportion offers the opportunity to describe excretion versus time. Coupling this data with drug concentration makes it possible for forensic toxicologists and MROs to come to an informed decision regarding the involvement of this drug in a positive drug test result.Administration, Oral Adult Amphetamine / urine* Amphetamines / administration & dosage Amphetamines / pharmacokinetics* Amphetamines / urine Central Nervous System Stimulants / administration & dosage Central Nervous System Stimulants / pharmacokinetics* Central Nervous System Stimulants / urine Dextroamphetamine / urine* Humans Hydrogen-Ion Concentration Male Middle Aged Substance Abuse Detection Time FactorsQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Patients with myotonic dystrophy frequently suffer from excess daytime sleepiness, which can be a significant cause of disability. Previous studies have indicated that this excess daytime sleepiness is only occasionally due to obstructive sleep apnoea and may be principally of central nervous system origin. Modafinil has been successfully used to treat narcolepsy, a central disorder causing excess daytime sleepiness. We have investigated the use of this drug in myotonic dystrophy patients with excess daytime sleepiness. Patients were recruited from a clinic population on the basis of screening with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Patients scoring 10 and above were invited to participate in a randomized double-blind crossover trial of modafinil versus placebo, with four weeks in each arm of the study separated by a 2-week washout period. Patients were assessed by polysomnography at baseline. The primary outcome measures were change in both the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and a modified Maintenance of Wakefulness Test, which were measured at the start of each arm of the trial and in week 3 of each intervention period. In agreement with previous smaller studies, sleepiness is not correlated with CTG expansion size. Treatment with modafinil showed a non-significant reduction in median Epworth Sleepiness Scale. However, the median Maintenance of Wakefulness Test score was prolonged by treatment (31.7-40 min, P=0.006). There were no significant adverse cardiac effects of the drug in this group of patients (resting 12 lead and 24 h ECG monitoring). Selected patients with myotonic dystrophy and excess daytime sleepiness may benefit from modafinil. In this patient group the Epworth Sleepiness Scale may not be the most reliable measure of sleepiness. Despite the potential for cardiac disease in these patients, the drug was well tolerated with no adverse effects.Adult Aged Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use* Central Nervous System Stimulants / therapeutic use* Cross-Over Studies Disorders of Excessive Somnolence / drug therapy* Disorders of Excessive Somnolence / etiology Disorders of Excessive Somnolence / physiopathology Double-Blind Method Female Humans Male Middle Aged Modafinil Myotonic Dystrophy / complications Myotonic Dystrophy / physiopathology* Neuropsychological Tests Polysomnography Surveys and Questionnaires Treatment OutcomeQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Modafinil is a selective wakefulness-promoting agent with beneficial effects in narcolepsy and conditions of sleep deprivation. In a double-blind study we examined its effects in 30 healthy, non sleep-deprived students (19 men and 11 women, aged 19-23 years), who were randomly allocated to placebo, 100 or 200 mg modafinil and 3 h later completed 100 mm visual analogue scales relating to mood and bodily symptoms, before and after an extensive battery of cognitive tests (pen and paper and CANTAB). There were no significant differences between the three treatment groups on any of the cognitive tests used in this study. There was a significant post-treatment change in the factor measuring 'somatic anxiety' and in individual ratings of 'shaking', 'palpitations', 'dizziness', 'restlessness', 'muscular tension', 'physical tiredness' and 'irritability', which was mainly due to significantly higher ratings of somatic anxiety in the 100 mg group compared with the other two groups. Further changes in mood were revealed after the stress of cognitive testing, with the 100 mg group showing greater increases in the 'psychological anxiety' and the 'aggressive mood' factors (as measured from the Bond and Lader scales).Adult Affect / drug effects* Arousal / drug effects Benzhydryl Compounds / pharmacology* Central Nervous System Stimulants / pharmacology* Cognition / drug effects* Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Double-Blind Method Female Humans Male Modafinil Psychomotor Performance / drug effects* Task Performance and AnalysisQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Recent neuroimaging studies in narcolepsy discovered significant gray matter loss in the right prefrontal and frontomesial cortex, a critical region for executive processing. In the present study, event-related potential (ERP) low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was used to investigate cognition before and after modafinil as compared with placebo.\n",
      "In a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over design, 15 patients were treated with a 3-week fixed titration scheme of modafinil and placebo. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) and auditory ERPs (odd-ball paradigm) were obtained before and after the 3 weeks of therapy. Latencies, amplitudes and LORETA sources were determined for standard (N1 and P2) and target (N2 and P300) ERP components.\n",
      "The ESS score improved significantly from 15.4 (+/- 4.0) under placebo to 10.2 (+/- 4.1) under 400mg modafinil (p=0.004). In the MWT, latency to sleep increased nonsignificantly after modafinil treatment (11.9+/-6.9 versus 13.3+/-7.1 min). In the ERP, N2 and P300 latencies were shortened significantly. While ERP amplitudes showed only minor changes, LORETA revealed increased source strengths: for N1 in the left auditory cortex and for P300 in the medial and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.\n",

      "Modafinil is a novel wake-promoting agent being developed for treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. An open, 3 x 3 Latin square, randomized, cross-over study was performed in healthy males to compare the pharmacokinetics of single-dose oral modafinil (200 mg) and methylphenidate (40 mg) administered alone or in combination. Blood samples were obtained for analysis of d- and l-threo-methylphenidate and modafinil and its acid and sulfone metabolites. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by noncompartmental methods, but could not be evaluated for modafinil sulfone due to plasma levels that were close to the assay quantitation limit. Although sporadic differences in plasma concentrations were observed between treatments, coadministration of modafinil and methylphenidate did not significantly alter the plasma concentrations of modafinil, modafinil acid, modafinil sulfone, or methylphenidate enantiomers compared with administration of these agents alone. Half-life (t1/2), maximum concentration (Cmax), area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-infinity), total clearance (Cl/F), and apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) for modafinil and t1/2, Cmax, and AUC0-infinity for modafinil acid were not affected by concomitant administration of methylphenidate. Small but statistically significant increases in time to Cmax (tmax) were observed for modafinil and modafinil acid after methylphenidate coadministration compared with modafinil alone. Modafinil coadministration did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of d- or l-threo-methylphenidate, except for a small decrease in Vd/F of l-threo-methylphenidate. Concomitant methylphenidate may cause a delay in the oral absorption of modafinil, but this delay might not be relevant clinically. Coadministration did not alter the extent of oral absorption and disposition of either agent. Therefore, a pharmacokinetic interaction between modafinil and methylphenidate would be unlikely.Adolescent Adrenergic Agents / administration & dosage Adrenergic Agents / adverse effects Adrenergic Agents / pharmacokinetics* Adrenergic Agents / pharmacology Adult Benzhydryl Compounds / administration & dosage Benzhydryl Compounds / adverse effects Benzhydryl Compounds / pharmacokinetics* Benzhydryl Compounds / pharmacology Central Nervous System Stimulants / administration & dosage Central Nervous System Stimulants / adverse effects Central Nervous System Stimulants / pharmacokinetics* Central Nervous System Stimulants / pharmacology Cross-Over Studies Double-Blind Method Drug Interactions Humans Male Methylphenidate / administration & dosage Methylphenidate / adverse effects Methylphenidate / pharmacokinetics* Methylphenidate / pharmacology Middle Aged ModafinilQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Excessive daytime somnolence (EDS) commonly complicates Parkinson's disease (PD). The aetiology of EDS is probably multifactorial but is probably exacerbated by dopaminergic medications. Modafinil is a wake-promoting agent approved for use in narcolepsy, but it is often used to treat a variety of somnolent conditions.\n",
      "A double blind, placebo controlled parallel design trial was conducted to assess the efficacy of modafinil (200-400 mg/day) for the treatment of EDS in PD.

      "Modafinil is an alerting substance which has been used successfully to treat narcolepsy. Nothing is known about its effect on hormone secretions. For this purpose, eight healthy young men were enrolled in a double blind trial to test the effects of modafinil on daily plasma melatonin, cortisol and growth hormone (GH) rhythms. Blood was sampled for hormone assays, every hour during the daytime and every 30 min during the nighttime. In addition, rectal temperature and mental performances were determined during the study which comprised 3 sessions, two weeks apart: a 24 h control session including a night with sleep (S1) and two 48 h sessions S2 and S3 with a sleep-deprived night (N1) followed by a recovery night (N2). Modafinil (300 mg x 2) or placebo were randomly attributed during N1 at 22 h and 8 h. As expected, performance was improved after modafinil administration and body temperature was maintained or increased. Plasma melatonin and cortisol profiles were similar after modafinil and placebo administration. The levels observed during the recovery and the control nights (N2) displayed no difference. For GH, during both sleep deprived nights, secretion was dramatically reduced compared with the control one, although the number of secretory episodes was unchanged. These data show that the alerting property of modafinil is not related to an alteration of hormone profiles and suggest that the acute modafinil administration is devoid of short-term side-effects.Adult Benzhydryl Compounds / pharmacology* Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use Body Temperature / drug effects* Central Nervous System Stimulants / pharmacology* Central Nervous System Stimulants / therapeutic use Health Status Human Growth Hormone / metabolism* Humans Hydrocortisone / metabolism* Male Melatonin / blood* Melatonin / metabolism* Modafinil Narcolepsy / drug therapy Narcolepsy / etiology Psychomotor Performance / drug effects* Rectum* Sleep Deprivation* Time FactorsQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Armodafinil (Nuvigil(®), Cephalon, Inc., Frazer, PA, USA), the longer-lasting isomer of racemic modafinil, is a nonamphetamine, wakefulness-promoting medication. In patients with excessive sleepiness associated with shift work disorder, treated obstructive sleep apnoea, or narcolepsy, armodafinil has been found to improve wakefulness throughout the shift or day. In addition, while not approved for this indication, armodafinil has been found to improve excessive sleepiness associated with jet-lag disorder.\n",
      "This study evaluated systemic exposure to armodafinil and its two major circulating metabolites, R-modafinil acid and modafinil sulfone, and assessed the tolerability profile of armodafinil in elderly and young subjects.\n",
      "The pharmacokinetics and tolerability of armodafinil were assessed in an open-label, multiple-dose, parallel-group study in two groups (n = 25 in each group) of healthy men (elderly group aged ≥65 years and young group aged 18-45 years) who received armodafinil 50 mg on day 1, 100 mg on day 2 and 150 mg once daily on days 3 through 7. Plasma concentrations of armodafinil and its metabolites were quantified over 72 hours following the last dose on day 7. Pharmacokinetic parameters, including area under the plasma drug concentration-versus-time curve during a dosing interval (AUC(τ)) and maximum observed plasma drug concentration (C(max)), and tolerability were assessed.\n",
      "All 50 subjects enrolled in the study were evaluable for tolerability and 49 were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis. One elderly subject was excluded from the pharmacokinetic analyses because of apparent noncompliance with armodafinil dosing. Systemic exposure following administration of armodafinil, as measured by steady-state AUC(τ) and C(max) values, was approximately 15% greater in elderly subjects compared with young subjects. Geometric mean ratios for AUC(τ) and C(max) in the two groups were 1.14 (95% CI 1.03, 1.25; p = 0.0086) and 1.15 (95% CI 1.08, 1.24; p = 0.0002), respectively. When data were analysed for elderly subgroups, systemic exposure in the old-elderly group (age ≥75 years; n = 7) was 27% greater than in young subjects, as compared with 10% greater in the young-elderly group (age 65-74 years; n = 17). Although steady-state exposure to the metabolite R-modafinil acid was also higher in elderly than in young subjects (geometric mean ratios for AUC(τ) and C(max) were 1.73 and 1.61, respectively; p < 0.0001), there were no significant differences in systemic exposure to modafinil sulfone. Armodafinil was generally well tolerated by both groups. Headache (four subjects in each group), nausea (one in the elderly group and four in the young group), insomnia (two in the elderly group and one in the young group), and dizziness (two in the young group) were the most common adverse events.\n",
      "Systemic exposure following administration of armodafinil is increased in the elderly in comparison with younger subjects, particularly in those aged ≥75 years. Although the increase in plasma armodafinil concentration in elderly subjects does not appear to result in more adverse events compared with young subjects, consideration should be given to the use of lower dosages of armodafinil for the management of excessive sleepiness in older patients, particularly the very elderly.Adult Age Factors Aged Area Under Curve Benzhydryl Compounds / administration & dosage* Benzhydryl Compounds / adverse effects* Benzhydryl Compounds / blood Benzhydryl Compounds / pharmacokinetics Central Nervous System Stimulants / administration & dosage* Central Nervous System Stimulants / adverse effects* Central Nervous System Stimulants / blood Central Nervous System Stimulants / pharmacokinetics Humans Male Modafinil Wakefulness / drug effectsQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "This 5-week, randomized, open-label study evaluated three strategies for switching patients from methylphenidate, a commonly used psychostimulant, to modafinil.\n",
      "Patients ( n=40) with excessive daytime sleepiness related to narcolepsy, who had received previous treatment with methylphenidate, were switched from methylphenidate to modafinil (200 mg/day followed by 400 mg/day) without a washout period between treatments, with a 2-day washout period between treatments, or by using a taper-down/titrate-up protocol. Adverse events were recorded throughout the study, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores were determined at the end of the study.\n",
      "The majority of patients (95%) were successfully switched to modafinil. At the study end point, mean Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores were <12 for each treatment group. All three switching strategies were well tolerated, with adverse events mild or moderate in nature. Adverse events most frequently reported during modafinil treatment were among those seen previously in large-scale, placebo-controlled studies. There were no meaningful differences among the treatment groups in the frequency or severity of adverse events or in their relationship to modafinil treatment. Only one patient discontinued modafinil treatment because of a treatment-related adverse event (i.e. moderate headache); another patient discontinued due to insufficient efficacy.\n",
      "Switching from methylphenidate to modafinil was well tolerated with or without a washout period or when the methylphenidate dose is gradually tapered during initiation of modafinil therapy. Daytime wakefulness was maintained in patients who have switched from methylphenidate to modafinil. These data suggest that patients with narcolepsy may be switched from methylphenidate to modafinil with few complications and inconveniences.Adolescent Adult Aged Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use* Central Nervous System Stimulants / therapeutic use* Drug Administration Schedule Female Humans Male Methylphenidate / therapeutic use* Middle Aged Modafinil Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Treatment Outcome Wakefulness / drug effectsQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "To assess the efficacy and safety of modafinil for the treatment of fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS).\n",
      "Patients aged 18-65 years with a diagnosis of MS, a stable disability level < or =6 on the Kurtzke extended disability status scale (EDSS), and a mean score >4 on the fatigue severity scale (FSS) were eligible for the 9 week, single blind, phase 2, two centre study. Exclusion criteria included a diagnosis of narcolepsy, sleep apnoea, or clinically significant major systemic disease and recent use of medications affecting fatigue. All patients, who remained blinded for the treatment regimen, received placebo during weeks 1-2, 200 mg/day modafinil during weeks 3-4, 400 mg/day modafinil during weeks 5-6, and placebo during weeks 7-9. Safety was evaluated by unblinded investigators. Efficacy was evaluated by self rating scales, using the FSS, the modified fatigue impact scale (MFIS), a visual analogue scale for fatigue (VAS-F), and the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS). Adverse events were recorded.\n",
      "Seventy two patients (MS type: 74% relapsing-remitting; 7% primary progressive; 19% secondary progressive) received treatment. After treatment with 200 mg/day modafinil for 2 weeks, a significant improvement in fatigue versus placebo run in was demonstrated. Mean scores after treatment with 200 mg/day modafinil were: FSS, 4.7 versus 5.5 for placebo (p<0.001); MFIS, 37.7 versus 44.7 (p<0.001); and VAS-F, 5.4 versus 4.5 (p=0.003). Fatigue scores for 400 mg/day modafinil were not significantly improved versus placebo run in. Mean ESS scores were significantly improved (p<0.001) with 200 mg/day modafinil (7.2) and 400 mg/day (7.0) versus the score at baseline (9.5). Serious adverse events were not found at either dose.

      "Recent data suggest that melatonin may influence human physiology, including the sleep-wake cycle, in a time-dependent manner via the body's internal clock. Rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep expression is strongly circadian modulated, and the impact of REM sleep on primary brain functions, metabolic processes, and immune system function has become increasingly clear over the past decade. In our study, we evaluated the effects of exogenous melatonin on disturbed REM sleep in humans. Fourteen consecutive outpatients (five women, nine men; mean age, 50 yr) with unselected neuropsychiatric sleep disorders and reduced REM sleep duration (25% or more below age norm according to diagnostic polysomnography) were included in two consecutive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design clinical trials. Patients received 3 mg melatonin daily, administered between 2200 and 2300 h for 4 wk. The results of the study show that melatonin was significantly more effective than placebo: patients on melatonin experienced significant increases in REM sleep percentage (baseline/melatonin, 14.7/17.8 vs. baseline/placebo, 14.3/12.0) and improvements in subjective measures of daytime dysfunction as well as clinical global impression score. Melatonin did not shift circadian phase or suppress temperature but did increase REM sleep continuity and promote decline in rectal temperature during sleep. These results were confirmed in patients who received melatonin in the second study (REM sleep percentage baseline/placebo/melatonin, 14.3/12.0/17.9). In patients who received melatonin in the first study and placebo in the second, the above mentioned effects outlasted the period of melatonin administration and diminished only slowly over time (REM sleep percentage baseline/melatonin/placebo, 14.7/17.8/16.2). Our findings show that exogenous melatonin, when administered at the appropriate time, seems to normalize circadian variation in human physiology. It may, therefore, have a strong impact on general health, especially in the elderly and in shift workers.Adult Aged Circadian Rhythm / drug effects Double-Blind Method Female Humans Male Melatonin / administration & dosage* Melatonin / analogs & derivatives* Melatonin / urine Middle Aged Narcolepsy / drug therapy Nocturnal Myoclonus Syndrome / drug therapy Placebos Restless Legs Syndrome / drug therapy Sleep Wake Disorders / drug therapy* Sleep, REM* / drug effects Time FactorsQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Sleep loss and increased sleepiness on the job are among the most prevalent problems encountered by people involved in night shift work, especially in cases of abrupt shift of the wake-sleep cycle. In such conditions, detrimental effects on performance are well documented. In these situations, to avoid decrements of performance at night, one possibility is to use hypnotics for improving the quality and quantity of daytime sleep. In this study, we evaluated the effects of 20 mg of temazepam on daytime sleep, the subsequent levels of nocturnal alertness/sleepiness, and performance in a laboratory simulation of acute night shift. For evaluating alertness, sleepiness, and performance we used, respectively, the maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT), the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), and two pencil and paper tests: digit symbol substitution test (DSST) and deux barrages test (DBT). All tests were administered four times at 2-hour intervals during the nighttime after daytime sleep. Results showed that the ability to maintain wakefulness (MWT) and to perform some visuo-attentive tasks were substantially maintained during the night. On the other hand, sleep tendency (MSLT) linearly increased during the night. Temazepam resulted in being an effective diurnal hypnotic, increasing total sleep time with no residual detrimental effects on sleepiness and performance and with an increase in the ability to stay awake.Adult GABA Modulators / pharmacology* Humans Male Narcolepsy* Polysomnography Sleep Stages Sleep, REM / drug effects* Temazepam / pharmacology* Wakefulness / drug effects* Wechsler Scales Work Schedule Tolerance*Q: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (Q/LAIV) was licensed in 2012 and replaced trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine in the United States during the 2013-2014 influenza season. This study assessed the safety of Q/LAIV in children and adults aged 2-49years.\n",
      "This was a prospective observational cohort study using data collected from Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Post-vaccination events of interest were any hospitalization, hospitalization for lower respiratory tract infection, and the following medically attended events: hypersensitivity, seizures/convulsions, lower respiratory tract infection, wheezing, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Bell's palsy, encephalitis, neuritis, vasculitis, and narcolepsy/cataplexy. The rates of these events during the risk interval post-vaccination were compared with rates observed during reference periods later in the follow-up (within-cohort analysis) and with rates observed in frequency-matched unvaccinated controls and inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) recipients.\n",
      "A total of 62,040 eligible Q/LAIV recipients were identified during the 2013-2014 influenza season. Within-cohort comparisons of all Q/LAIV recipients as well as comparisons between Q/LAIV recipients and unvaccinated controls or IIV recipients did not show any significantly higher risk of hospitalizations or medically attended events following administration of Q/LAIV. Additional analyses by setting (clinic visits, emergency department visits, and hospital admissions) and age group (2-4, 5-8, 9-17, and 18-49years) also did not reveal clinically consistent findings that suggested any increased risk after administration of Q/LAIV.\n",

      "Various Japanese versions of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) have been used, but none was developed via standard procedures. Here we report on the construction and testing of the developer-authorized Japanese version of the ESS (JESS).\n",
      "Developing the JESS involved translations, back translations, a pilot study, and psychometric testing. We identified questions in the ESS that were difficult to answer or were inappropriate in Japan, proposed possible replacements for those questions, and tested them with analyses based on item response theory (IRT) and classical test theory. The subjects were healthy people and patients with narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, or obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.\n",
      "We identified two of our proposed questions as appropriate replacements for two problematic questions in the ESS. The JESS had very few missing data. Internal consistency reliability and test-retest reliability were high. The patients had significantly higher JESS scores than did the healthy people, and higher JESS scores were associated with worse daytime function, as measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.\n",

      "The effects of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB: 25 mg/kg h.s. and 3 h later) vs. placebo on objectively evaluated nighttime sleep and daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy were evaluated in a double-blind, counterbalanced crossover design. Twenty narcolepsy patients were given an overnight polysomnogram (PSG), followed by a daytime multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) at baseline and on the 1st and 29th days of GHB and placebo treatment. The overnight PSGs indicated that the narcolepsy patients had the following significant results during GHB versus placebo treatment: decreased stage 1 (p = 0.012), increased stage 3 (p = 0.008), increased delta (stage 3 and 4 combined) sleep (p = 0.049), fewer stage shifts (p = 0.002), and fewer awakenings (p = 0.006). Minutes of wakefulness were significantly increased only for the last 2 h of the 8 h sleep period on GHB versus placebo (p = 0.019), which is beyond the time of GHB's direct influence. The MSLTs indicated that the narcolepsy patients had a marginally increased sleep latency mean during GHB versus placebo treatment (p = 0.074) and significantly increased total stage 0 (wakefulness) on day 29 of GHB versus day 29 of placebo treatment (p = 0.038). Female narcolepsy patients had significantly fewer naps with REM sleep (REM naps) on day 29 of GHB vs. day 29 of placebo treatment (p = 0.020). The therapeutic effect of GHB in narcolepsy patients, i.e., decreases cataplexy, appears to be due to its improving nocturnal sleep quality, since its half-life is only 1.5 to 2 h. It is conjectured that GHB, an endogenous neurochemical, may be a sleep neurotransmitter or neuromodulator, since GHB rapidly induces sleep, and increases sleep continuity and delta sleep without suppressing REM sleep in both normals and narcolepsy patients.Adult Double-Blind Method Electroencephalography Electromyography Electrooculography Female Humans Male Middle Aged Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Narcolepsy / physiopathology Sleep / drug effects* Sleep / physiology Sodium Oxybate / pharmacology* Sodium Oxybate / therapeutic use Wakefulness / drug effects Wakefulness / physiologyQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "Patients suffering from narcolepsy type 1 show altered skin temperatures, resembling the profile that is related to sleep onset in healthy controls. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of sodium oxybate, a widely used drug to treat narcolepsy, on the 24-h profiles of temperature and sleep-wakefulness in patients with narcolepsy and controls. Eight hypocretin-deficient male narcolepsy type 1 patients and eight healthy matched controls underwent temperature measurement of core body and proximal and distal skin twice, and the sleep-wake state for 24 h. After the baseline assessment, 2 × 3 g of sodium oxybate was administered for 5 nights, immediately followed by the second assessment. At baseline, daytime core body temperature and proximal skin temperature were significantly lower in patients with narcolepsy (core: 36.8 ± 0.05 °C versus 37.0 ± 0.05 °C, F = 8.31, P = 0.01; proximal: 33.4 ± 0.26 °C versus 34.3 ± 0.26 °C, F = 5.66, P = 0.03). In patients, sodium oxybate administration increased proximal skin temperature during the day (F = 6.46, P = 0.04) to a level similar as in controls, but did not affect core body temperature, distal temperature or distal-proximal temperature gradient. Sodium oxybate administration normalised the predictive value of distal skin temperature and distal-proximal temperature gradient for the onset of daytime naps (P < 0.01). In conclusion, sodium oxybate administration resulted in a partial normalisation of the skin temperature profile, by increasing daytime proximal skin temperature, and by strengthening the known relationship between skin temperature and daytime sleep propensity. These changes seem to be related to the clinical improvement induced by sodium oxybate treatment. A causal relationship is not proven.Adolescent Adult Aged Body Temperature Regulation / drug effects* Case-Control Studies Drug Administration Schedule Humans Male Middle Aged Narcolepsy / drug therapy Narcolepsy / physiopathology* Orexins / deficiency Skin Temperature / drug effects* Sleep / drug effects Sleep / physiology Sodium Oxybate / administration & dosage Sodium Oxybate / pharmacology* Sodium Oxybate / therapeutic use Time Factors Wakefulness / drug effects Wakefulness / physiology Young AdultQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "The safety and efficacy of low-sodium oxybate (LXB; Xywav\n",
      "In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal trial of LXB, TEAEs were evaluated during the 12-week OLOTTP, the 2-week SDP, and the subsequent 24-week OLE. Eligible participants were aged 18-70 years with a diagnosis of narcolepsy with cataplexy. At study entry, participants were taking sodium oxybate (SXB) alone, SXB with other anticataplectics, other anticataplectics alone, or were anticataplectic-treatment naive; other anticataplectics were tapered and discontinued during the OLOTTP. All participants initiated LXB during week 1 of the OLOTTP, and their dose was individually titrated based on safety and efficacy. Following the main study period, participants entered the OLE after rescreening (re-entry) after discontinuing LXB treatment or directly after completing the main study (rollover). TEAEs were assessed in the safety population as of database lock. TEAE duration was defined as time from TEAE start date to end date (or end of SDP or OLE, if end date was unrecorded).\n",
      "The safety population included 201 participants (SXB alone, n = 52; SXB with other anticataplectics, n = 23; other anticataplectics alone, n = 36; anticataplectic-treatment naive, n = 90). During the OLOTTP/SDP, headache was the most common LXB-emergent TEAE overall (71 events; n = 42 (21%); median (range) duration = 1 (1-147) day), followed by nausea (31 events; n = 26 (13%); median (range) duration = 9 (1-54) days) and dizziness (26 events; n = 21 (10%); median (range) duration = 7 (1-117) days). Among the 74 participants in the OLE, the most commonly reported TEAEs were headache (14 events; n = 7, 9%; peak incidence month 3 (n = 5/72); median (range) duration = 1 (1‒25) day), dizziness (8 events; n = 5, 7%; peak incidence month 1 (n = 3/74); median (range) duration = 26 (1‒181) days), and nasopharyngitis (6 events; n = 6, 8%; peak incidence month 6 (n = 2/69); median (range) duration = 9 (1‒24) days). Overall, study discontinuations attributed to TEAEs were 21/65 (32%) during the OLOTTP and SDP and 3/7 (43%) during the OLE.\n",
      "In this long-term analysis, the safety and tolerability profile of LXB was generally consistent with the known safety profile of SXB. During the OLOTTP and SDP, most TEAEs occurred early and were generally of short duration. TEAE prevalence decreased throughout the duration of the OLE; the most common TEAEs reported during the OLE were headache, dizziness, and nasopharyngitis.\n",

      "Low-sodium oxybate (LXB) is a medicine for narcolepsy. LXB treats daytime sleepiness and cataplexy (sudden muscle weakness). LXB is like sodium oxybate (SXB) but has 92% less sodium. This study looked at side effects in people taking LXB for many months. Three study periods were looked at in this report. In period 1, people could change their LXB dose for 12 weeks. This was to find their best dose. In period 2, people took that same best dose for 2 weeks. In period 3, some people kept taking LXB for 24 weeks. This was to study the longer-term effects. Everyone knew that they were taking LXB. During periods 1 and 2, the most common side effect was headache. Nausea and dizziness were also common. During period 3, headache was also the most common side effect. Dizziness and nasopharyngitis were also common. Nasopharyngitis is a cold in the nose and throat. In periods 1 and 2, most side effects happened early on. They also ended quickly. Fewer side effects happened in period 3. Among people leaving the study early, 32% left because of side effects during periods 1 and 2. During period 3, 43% left because of side effects. Overall, long-term side effects in people taking LXB were similar to those seen with SXB.Adult Cataplexy* / drug therapy Dizziness / chemically induced Dizziness / drug therapy Double-Blind Method Headache / drug therapy Humans Narcolepsy* / drug therapy Nasopharyngitis* / chemically induced Nasopharyngitis* / drug therapy Sodium Oxybate* / adverse effects Time Factors Treatment OutcomeQ: Does the article explicitly mention the clinical trial phase of the study, like Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3?\n",

      "To determine whether nocturnal administration of sodium oxybate, a first-line treatment in narcolepsy, is effective and safe for excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and disturbed nighttime sleep in patients with PD.\n",
      "Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover phase 2a study carried out between January 9, 2015, and February 24, 2017. In a single-center study in the sleep laboratory at the University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, 18 patients with PD and EDS (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS] score >10) were screened in the sleep laboratory. Five patients were excluded owing to the polysomnographic diagnosis of sleep apnea and 1 patient withdrew consent. Thus, 12 patients were randomized to a treatment sequence (sodium oxybate followed by placebo or placebo followed by sodium oxybate, ratio 1:1) and, after dropout of 1 patient owing to an unrelated adverse event during the washout period, 11 patients completed the study. Two patients developed obstructive sleep apnea during sodium oxybate treatment (1 was the dropout) and were excluded from the per-protocol analysis (n = 10) but included in the intention-to-treat analysis (n = 12).\n",
      "Nocturnal sodium oxybate and placebo taken at bedtime and 2.5 to 4.0 hours later with an individually titrated dose between 3.0 and 9.0 g per night for 6 weeks with a 2- to 4-week washout period interposed.\n",
      "Primary outcome measure was change of objective EDS as electrophysiologically measured by mean sleep latency in the Multiple Sleep Latency Test. Secondary outcome measures included change of subjective EDS (ESS), sleep quality (Parkinson Disease Sleep Scale-2), and objective variables of nighttime sleep (polysomnography).\n",
      "Among 12 patients in the intention-to-treat population (10 men, 2 women; mean [SD] age, 62 [11.1] years; disease duration, 8.4 [4.6] years), sodium oxybate substantially improved EDS as measured objectively (mean sleep latency, +2.9 minutes; 95% CI, 2.1 to 3.8 minutes; P = .002) and subjectively (ESS score, -4.2 points ; 95% CI, -5.3 to -3.0 points; P = .001). Thereby, 8 (67%) patients exhibited an electrophysiologically defined positive treatment response. Moreover, sodium oxybate significantly enhanced subjective sleep quality and objectively measured slow-wave sleep duration (+72.7 minutes; 95% CI, 55.7 to 89.7 minutes; P < .001). Differences were more pronounced in the per-protocol analysis. Sodium oxybate was generally well tolerated under dose adjustments (no treatment-related dropouts), but it induced de novo obstructive sleep apnea in 2 patients and parasomnia in 1 patient, as detected by polysomnography, all of whom did not benefit from sodium oxybate treatment.\n",
      "This study provides class I evidence for the efficacy of sodium oxybate in treating EDS and nocturnal sleep disturbance in patients with PD. Special monitoring with follow-up polysomnography is necessary to rule out treatment-related complications and larger follow-up trials with longer treatment durations are warranted for validation.\n",
