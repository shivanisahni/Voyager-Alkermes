Noninvasive ventilatory assistance, in ALS patients, with the bilevel intermittent positive air pressure (Bipap) was studied, in a prospective and controlled trial, by the authors. Twenty ALS bulbar patients, fulfilling El Escorial criteria for probable or definite disease, were selected. For the follow-up all patients were submitted to evaluation with the Norris scale, modified Barthel score and an analog scale of life satisfaction, every 3 months. All patients were also submitted to respiratory functional testing (RFT). Ten of these patients were treated with palliative management (group I), the remaining ten patients received Bipap support (group II). Clinical evolution curves and clinical parameters were not statistically different in both groups, except for the percentage of actual predicted value of vital capacity (p < 0.03), showing a more advanced disease in group II patients. Analog scale of life satisfaction showed improvement in the group II, even after the beginning of respiratory insufficiency, though without significance probably due to the small sample size (p < 0.1). Since 6 patients in group II are still alive survival rates were compared with log rank test considering cumulative survivals with Kaplan-Meier estimates. Total survival and survival from diurnal abnormalities in gas exchange (survival 1) were significantly longer for group II (p < 0.006 and p < 0.0004, respectively). In spite of the small number of patients, preliminary results strongly support the importance of BIPAP in ALS patients, though further studies must go on in order to optimize the best time for introducing Bipap.

Objective: To study the safety of 3-4 diaminopyridine (DAP) in patients with motor neuron diseases and to examine its efficacy in reducing muscle fatigue and weakness and in improving objective parameters of muscle function. Design: Assessments of safety included a questionnaire of symptoms, clinical examination, blood testing, and electrocardiography at each visit; efficacy was assessed by subjective scores of fatigue and weakness; an Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale and functional ability scores, including timed verbal scores; manual muscle testing; grip dynamometry; pulmonary function tests; timed functional tests; and electrophysiological studies. Participants: Thirteen subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and seven subjects with only a lower motor neuron syndrome. Main outcomes: Assess tolerability of DAP and determine if there was symptomatic improvement of muscle fatigue. SECONDARY OUTCOME: To determine the effects of DAP on objective parameters of muscle function. Results: The drug was well tolerated with only four subjects reporting tingling of lips and fingers during the active drug period. The subjective scores for fatigue and weakness showed a mild improvement after 4 weeks on DAP compared with placebo. A significant benefit of DAP was also demonstrated in the timed verbal scores. Conclusion: 3-4 DAP appeared to be safe and produced subjective benefit in motor neuron diseases. The drug could be added for symptomatic treatment in these diseases. Larger studies are necessary to demonstrate efficacy.

Objectives: There is currently no effective pharmacological treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In a transgenic mouse model of ALS, intrathecal infusion of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 showed a promising increase in survival. We performed a double-blind clinical trial to assess the effect of intrathecal administration of IGF-1 on disease progression in patients with ALS. Methods: Nine patients with ALS were randomly assigned to receive either a high dose (3 microg/kg of body weight) or low dose (0.5 microg/kg of body weight) of IGF-1 every 2 weeks for 40 weeks. The outcome measurements were the rate of decline of bulbar and limb functions (Norris scales) and forced vital capacity. Results: The high-dose treatment slowed a decline of motor functions of the ALS patients in total Norris and limb Norris scales, but not in bulbar Norris or vital capacity. The intrathecal administration of IGF-1 had a modest but significant beneficial effect in ALS patients without any serious adverse effects. Discussion: Intrathecal IGF-1 treatment could provide an effective choice for ALS although further studies in more patients are needed to confirm its efficacy and optimize dosages of IGF-1.

Maximal voluntary isometric grip and foot dorsiflexion (FD) strength and forced vital capacity (FVC) were obtained in 62 patients with ALS at or close to enrollment into two clinical trials. The agents tested did not slow disease progression. Isometric strength data were standardized, and the worse side was taken. FVC was expressed as a percentage of the predicted value (FVC%). We derived linear estimates of rates of disease progression based on the isometric myometry and FVC measures and on disease duration. Forty one patients were known to have died or to have undergone tracheostomy for ventilatory support. Probability of tracheostomy-free survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The measured values, the linear estimates for rates of decline of these values, gender, age at onset, bulbar vs. spinal onset, height and weight were tested as risk factors within the Cox proportional hazards model, using regression techniques. When tested individually, estimates of rates of decline based on all three measures (FD, grip and FVC%) were the only statistically significant risk factors (P<0.005). Multivariate analysis resulted in a 3-variable model (chi-square=75.3, P<0.00001) in which estimated rates of decline of FD strength and of FVC%, and bulbar onset were independently significant (P<0.0001, P<0.0007 and P<0.05, respectively). We conclude that linear estimates of the rate of disease progression till enrollment into a clinical trial may be better predictors of patient survival than demographic data or discrete biologic measures.

Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder of the human motor system. Neuroinflammation appears to be an important modulator of disease progression in ALS. Specifically, reduction of regulatory T cell (Treg) levels, along with an increase in pro-inflammatory effector T cells, macrophage activation and upregulation of co-stimulatory pathways have all been associated with a rapid disease course in ALS. Autologous infusion of expanded Tregs into sporadic ALS patients, resulted in greater suppressive function, slowing of disease progression and stabilization of respiratory function. Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) increases the ratio of anti-inflammatory (Treg) to proinflammatory T-cells in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis and rebalances the regulatory: inflammatory axis towards a neuroprotective phenotype. Consequently, the aim of this study was to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Tecfidera in sporadic ALS. Methods: The study is an investigator led Phase 2 multi-center, randomized, placebo controlled, double blind clinical trial assessing the efficacy and safety of Tecfidera in patients with sporadic ALS. The study duration is 40 weeks, with a 36-week study period and end of study visit occurring at 40 weeks or at early termination/withdrawal from study. The TEALS study has been registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials registry (ANZCTR) under the trials registration number ACTRN12618000534280 and has been approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee and Research Governance Office at the lead site (Westmead Hospital) with the ethics number HREC/17/WMEAD/353. The participating sites have obtained site specific ethics and governance approvals from the local institution. Results: The primary endpoint is slowing of disease progression as reflected by the differences in the ALS Functional Rating Score-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score at Week 36. The secondary endpoints will include effects in survival, lower motor neuron function, respiratory function, quality of life and safety. Conclusion: This Phase 2 multi-center, randomized, placebo controlled, double blind clinical trial will provide evidence of efficacy and safety of Tecfidera in sporadic ALS.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressing, fatal disorder with no effective treatment. We used simple genetic models of ALS to screen phenotypically for potential therapeutic compounds. We screened libraries of compounds in C. elegans, validated hits in zebrafish, and tested the most potent molecule in mice and in a small clinical trial. We identified a class of neuroleptics that restored motility in C. elegans and in zebrafish, and the most potent was pimozide, which blocked T-type Ca2+ channels in these simple models and stabilized neuromuscular transmission in zebrafish and enhanced it in mice. Finally, a short randomized controlled trial of sporadic ALS subjects demonstrated stabilization of motility and evidence of target engagement at the neuromuscular junction. Simple genetic models are, thus, useful in identifying promising compounds for the treatment of ALS, such as neuroleptics, which may stabilize neuromuscular transmission and prolong survival in this disease.

Context: Patients with terminal illnesses often require surrogate decision makers. Prior research has demonstrated high surrogate stress, and that despite standards promoting substituted judgment, most patients do not want their surrogates to make pure substituted judgments for them. It is not known how best to help loved ones fulfill the surrogate role. Objectives: To test the effectiveness of an intervention to help surrogate decision makers. Methods: One hundred sixty-six patients (41% with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 59% with gastrointestinal cancers) and their surrogates at two university medical centers were randomized to an intensive nurse-directed discussion of the end-of-life decision control preferences of the patient (TAILORED) or a discussion of nutrition (CONTROL); 163 completed baseline interviews and underwent the intervention. Results: Twelve patients died during follow-up and 137 dyads completed the study. Post-intervention, using all available data, TAILORED patients and surrogates became more likely to endorse mutual surrogate decision making, that is, a balance of their own wishes and what the surrogate thinks best (adjusted odds compared with baseline for patients = 1.78, P = 0.04; adjusted odds for surrogates = 2.05, P = 0.03). CONTROL patients became 40% less likely to endorse mutual surrogate decision making (P = 0.08), and CONTROL surrogates did not change significantly from baseline (adjusted odds = 1.44, P = 0.28). Stress levels decreased for TAILORED surrogates (impact of events scale = 23.1 ± 14.6 baseline, 20.8 ± 15.3 f/u, P = 0.046), but not for CONTROL (P = 0.85), and post-intervention stress was lower for TAILORED than CONTROL (P = 0.04). Surrogates' confidence was uniformly high at baseline and did not change. Caregiver burden (Zarit) increased from 12.5 ± 6.5 to 14.7 ± 8.1 for TAILORED (P < 0.01), while not changing for CONTROL, yet satisfaction with involvement in decision making was higher at follow-up for TAILORED than for CONTROL (71% vs. 52%, P = 0.03). Conclusion: TAILORED patients and surrogates who completed the study adopted a more mutual decision-making style, balancing their own wishes with what the surrogate thinks would be best for them. Surrogates reported less stress and more satisfaction. Confidence was high at baseline and did not change. There was a modest increase in caregiver burden. These findings suggest that interventions like TAILORED might positively impact surrogate decision making. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01160367.

Background: Edaravone slowed the rate of functional decline in subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in phase 3 study MCI186-19 (Study 19). One of the Study 19 inclusion criteria was forced vital capacity (FVC) ≥80% of predicted (≥80%p). Therefore, the study provided no information on edaravone efficacy in subjects with FVC <80%p. In Study 19, 24-week, double-blind treatment was followed by open-label treatment where all subjects received edaravone. At 24 weeks, some subjects had FVC <80%p (FVC24 <80%p). This allowed for post-hoc assessment of the effects of edaravone in subgroups of subjects with FVC24 ≥80%p vs <80%p. Objective: To address the question of the efficacy of edaravone in ALS patients with FVC <80%p. Methods: Post-hoc analysis of Study 19 comparing edaravone efficacy at week 48 in subjects with FVC24 ≥80%p vs <80%p. Results: With edaravone treatment, subjects in both the FVC24 ≥80%p and the FVC24 <80%p subgroups experienced a reduction in ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score loss vs placebo subjects through week 48. For the FVC24 ≥80%p subgroup, the changes in ALSFRS-R scores from baseline to week 48 were -7.63 for edaravone-edaravone vs -9.69 for placebo-edaravone, a difference of 2.05 (P = .034; 95% CI: 0.16, 3.94). For the FVC24 <80%p subgroup, the changes in ALSFRS-R scores from baseline to week 48 were -10.26 for edaravone-edaravone vs -15.20 for placebo-edaravone, a difference of 4.94 (P = .0038; 95% CI: 1.64, 8.25). Linear regression analysis indicated that, in the FVC24 <80%p subgroup, there was a notable change in the slope of the ALSFRS-R score-vs-time graph after the start of edaravone treatment. Conclusion: ALS subjects in the Study 19 placebo arm had a slowing in disease progression, even when edaravone was added with an FVC of <80%p prior to starting edaravone. A randomized, placebo-controlled study is needed to validate these post-hoc findings.

Objective: Exercise may be physically and psychologically important for people with ALS, especially in the earlier stages of the disease, and, as a consequence, current ALS clinical management includes individualized rehabilitation as part of multidisciplinary care because. However, while recent studies focused on which type of exercise is more indicated to ALS patients, there is no evidence at which frequency training sessions should be performed. Methods: We performed an assessor blinded randomized clinical trial to investigate the superiority of two different frequencies of exercise on rate of progression in ALS. We enrolled 65 patients in two groups: intensive exercise regimen (IER, five sessions/week) versus usual exercise regimen (UER, two sessions/week). The primary aim was to assess if IER decreased disease progression, measured through Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised, with respect to UER. Secondary aims included assessment of adverse events, tracheostomy-free survival, motor and respiratory functions, fatigue, quality of life and caregiver burden. Treatment regimen consisted for both groups of the same kind of exercise including aerobic training, endurance training, stretching or assisted active mobilization, differing for frequency of intervention. Results: No significant changes in disease progression were found in patients under IER versus UER. At the end of the study, there were no significant differences between the two groups in survival, respiratory function, time to supporting procedures, and quality of life. Adverse events, fatigue, and caregiver burden were not different between the two treatment regimens. Conclusions: Despite some limitations, our trial demonstrated that high-frequency physical exercise was not superior to UER on ALSFRS-R scores, motor and respiratory functions, survival, fatigue, and quality of life of ALS patients.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cortical and spinal motor neuron dysfunction. Routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have previously shown hypointense signal in the motor cortex on T(2)-weighted images in some ALS patients, however, the cause of this finding is unknown. To investigate the utility of this MR signal change as a marker of cortical motor neuron degeneration, signal abnormalities on 3T and 7T MR images of the brain were compared, and pathology was obtained in two ALS patients to determine the origin of the motor cortex hypointensity. Nineteen patients with clinically probable or definite ALS by El Escorial criteria and 19 healthy controls underwent 3T MRI. A 7T MRI scan was carried out on five ALS patients who had motor cortex hypointensity on the 3T FLAIR sequence and on three healthy controls. Postmortem 7T MRI of the brain was performed in one ALS patient and histological studies of the brains and spinal cords were obtained post-mortem in two patients. The motor cortex hypointensity on 3T FLAIR images was present in greater frequency in ALS patients. Increased hypointensity correlated with greater severity of upper motor neuron impairment. Analysis of 7T T(2)(*)-weighted gradient echo imaging localized the signal alteration to the deeper layers of the motor cortex in both ALS patients. Pathological studies showed increased iron accumulation in microglial cells in areas corresponding to the location of the signal changes on the 3T and 7T MRI of the motor cortex. These findings indicate that the motor cortex hypointensity on 3T MRI FLAIR images in ALS is due to increased iron accumulation by microglia. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00334516.
