Noninvasive ventilatory assistance, in ALS patients, with the bilevel intermittent positive air pressure (Bipap) was studied, in a prospective and controlled trial, by the authors. Twenty ALS bulbar patients, fulfilling El Escorial criteria for probable or definite disease, were selected. For the follow-up all patients were submitted to evaluation with the Norris scale, modified Barthel score and an analog scale of life satisfaction, every 3 months. All patients were also submitted to respiratory functional testing (RFT). Ten of these patients were treated with palliative management (group I), the remaining ten patients received Bipap support (group II). Clinical evolution curves and clinical parameters were not statistically different in both groups, except for the percentage of actual predicted value of vital capacity (p < 0.03), showing a more advanced disease in group II patients. Analog scale of life satisfaction showed improvement in the group II, even after the beginning of respiratory insufficiency, though without significance probably due to the small sample size (p < 0.1). Since 6 patients in group II are still alive survival rates were compared with log rank test considering cumulative survivals with Kaplan-Meier estimates. Total survival and survival from diurnal abnormalities in gas exchange (survival 1) were significantly longer for group II (p < 0.006 and p < 0.0004, respectively). In spite of the small number of patients, preliminary results strongly support the importance of BIPAP in ALS patients, though further studies must go on in order to optimize the best time for introducing Bipap.

Objective: To study the safety of 3-4 diaminopyridine (DAP) in patients with motor neuron diseases and to examine its efficacy in reducing muscle fatigue and weakness and in improving objective parameters of muscle function. Design: Assessments of safety included a questionnaire of symptoms, clinical examination, blood testing, and electrocardiography at each visit; efficacy was assessed by subjective scores of fatigue and weakness; an Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale and functional ability scores, including timed verbal scores; manual muscle testing; grip dynamometry; pulmonary function tests; timed functional tests; and electrophysiological studies. Participants: Thirteen subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and seven subjects with only a lower motor neuron syndrome. Main outcomes: Assess tolerability of DAP and determine if there was symptomatic improvement of muscle fatigue. SECONDARY OUTCOME: To determine the effects of DAP on objective parameters of muscle function. Results: The drug was well tolerated with only four subjects reporting tingling of lips and fingers during the active drug period. The subjective scores for fatigue and weakness showed a mild improvement after 4 weeks on DAP compared with placebo. A significant benefit of DAP was also demonstrated in the timed verbal scores. Conclusion: 3-4 DAP appeared to be safe and produced subjective benefit in motor neuron diseases. The drug could be added for symptomatic treatment in these diseases. Larger studies are necessary to demonstrate efficacy.

Objectives: There is currently no effective pharmacological treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In a transgenic mouse model of ALS, intrathecal infusion of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 showed a promising increase in survival. We performed a double-blind clinical trial to assess the effect of intrathecal administration of IGF-1 on disease progression in patients with ALS. Methods: Nine patients with ALS were randomly assigned to receive either a high dose (3 microg/kg of body weight) or low dose (0.5 microg/kg of body weight) of IGF-1 every 2 weeks for 40 weeks. The outcome measurements were the rate of decline of bulbar and limb functions (Norris scales) and forced vital capacity. Results: The high-dose treatment slowed a decline of motor functions of the ALS patients in total Norris and limb Norris scales, but not in bulbar Norris or vital capacity. The intrathecal administration of IGF-1 had a modest but significant beneficial effect in ALS patients without any serious adverse effects. Discussion: Intrathecal IGF-1 treatment could provide an effective choice for ALS although further studies in more patients are needed to confirm its efficacy and optimize dosages of IGF-1.

Maximal voluntary isometric grip and foot dorsiflexion (FD) strength and forced vital capacity (FVC) were obtained in 62 patients with ALS at or close to enrollment into two clinical trials. The agents tested did not slow disease progression. Isometric strength data were standardized, and the worse side was taken. FVC was expressed as a percentage of the predicted value (FVC%). We derived linear estimates of rates of disease progression based on the isometric myometry and FVC measures and on disease duration. Forty one patients were known to have died or to have undergone tracheostomy for ventilatory support. Probability of tracheostomy-free survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The measured values, the linear estimates for rates of decline of these values, gender, age at onset, bulbar vs. spinal onset, height and weight were tested as risk factors within the Cox proportional hazards model, using regression techniques. When tested individually, estimates of rates of decline based on all three measures (FD, grip and FVC%) were the only statistically significant risk factors (P<0.005). Multivariate analysis resulted in a 3-variable model (chi-square=75.3, P<0.00001) in which estimated rates of decline of FD strength and of FVC%, and bulbar onset were independently significant (P<0.0001, P<0.0007 and P<0.05, respectively). We conclude that linear estimates of the rate of disease progression till enrollment into a clinical trial may be better predictors of patient survival than demographic data or discrete biologic measures.

Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder of the human motor system. Neuroinflammation appears to be an important modulator of disease progression in ALS. Specifically, reduction of regulatory T cell (Treg) levels, along with an increase in pro-inflammatory effector T cells, macrophage activation and upregulation of co-stimulatory pathways have all been associated with a rapid disease course in ALS. Autologous infusion of expanded Tregs into sporadic ALS patients, resulted in greater suppressive function, slowing of disease progression and stabilization of respiratory function. Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) increases the ratio of anti-inflammatory (Treg) to proinflammatory T-cells in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis and rebalances the regulatory: inflammatory axis towards a neuroprotective phenotype. Consequently, the aim of this study was to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Tecfidera in sporadic ALS. Methods: The study is an investigator led Phase 2 multi-center, randomized, placebo controlled, double blind clinical trial assessing the efficacy and safety of Tecfidera in patients with sporadic ALS. The study duration is 40 weeks, with a 36-week study period and end of study visit occurring at 40 weeks or at early termination/withdrawal from study. The TEALS study has been registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials registry (ANZCTR) under the trials registration number ACTRN12618000534280 and has been approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee and Research Governance Office at the lead site (Westmead Hospital) with the ethics number HREC/17/WMEAD/353. The participating sites have obtained site specific ethics and governance approvals from the local institution. Results: The primary endpoint is slowing of disease progression as reflected by the differences in the ALS Functional Rating Score-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score at Week 36. The secondary endpoints will include effects in survival, lower motor neuron function, respiratory function, quality of life and safety. Conclusion: This Phase 2 multi-center, randomized, placebo controlled, double blind clinical trial will provide evidence of efficacy and safety of Tecfidera in sporadic ALS.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressing, fatal disorder with no effective treatment. We used simple genetic models of ALS to screen phenotypically for potential therapeutic compounds. We screened libraries of compounds in C. elegans, validated hits in zebrafish, and tested the most potent molecule in mice and in a small clinical trial. We identified a class of neuroleptics that restored motility in C. elegans and in zebrafish, and the most potent was pimozide, which blocked T-type Ca2+ channels in these simple models and stabilized neuromuscular transmission in zebrafish and enhanced it in mice. Finally, a short randomized controlled trial of sporadic ALS subjects demonstrated stabilization of motility and evidence of target engagement at the neuromuscular junction. Simple genetic models are, thus, useful in identifying promising compounds for the treatment of ALS, such as neuroleptics, which may stabilize neuromuscular transmission and prolong survival in this disease.

Context: Patients with terminal illnesses often require surrogate decision makers. Prior research has demonstrated high surrogate stress, and that despite standards promoting substituted judgment, most patients do not want their surrogates to make pure substituted judgments for them. It is not known how best to help loved ones fulfill the surrogate role. Objectives: To test the effectiveness of an intervention to help surrogate decision makers. Methods: One hundred sixty-six patients (41% with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 59% with gastrointestinal cancers) and their surrogates at two university medical centers were randomized to an intensive nurse-directed discussion of the end-of-life decision control preferences of the patient (TAILORED) or a discussion of nutrition (CONTROL); 163 completed baseline interviews and underwent the intervention. Results: Twelve patients died during follow-up and 137 dyads completed the study. Post-intervention, using all available data, TAILORED patients and surrogates became more likely to endorse mutual surrogate decision making, that is, a balance of their own wishes and what the surrogate thinks best (adjusted odds compared with baseline for patients = 1.78, P = 0.04; adjusted odds for surrogates = 2.05, P = 0.03). CONTROL patients became 40% less likely to endorse mutual surrogate decision making (P = 0.08), and CONTROL surrogates did not change significantly from baseline (adjusted odds = 1.44, P = 0.28). Stress levels decreased for TAILORED surrogates (impact of events scale = 23.1 ± 14.6 baseline, 20.8 ± 15.3 f/u, P = 0.046), but not for CONTROL (P = 0.85), and post-intervention stress was lower for TAILORED than CONTROL (P = 0.04). Surrogates' confidence was uniformly high at baseline and did not change. Caregiver burden (Zarit) increased from 12.5 ± 6.5 to 14.7 ± 8.1 for TAILORED (P < 0.01), while not changing for CONTROL, yet satisfaction with involvement in decision making was higher at follow-up for TAILORED than for CONTROL (71% vs. 52%, P = 0.03). Conclusion: TAILORED patients and surrogates who completed the study adopted a more mutual decision-making style, balancing their own wishes with what the surrogate thinks would be best for them. Surrogates reported less stress and more satisfaction. Confidence was high at baseline and did not change. There was a modest increase in caregiver burden. These findings suggest that interventions like TAILORED might positively impact surrogate decision making. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01160367.

Background: Edaravone slowed the rate of functional decline in subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in phase 3 study MCI186-19 (Study 19). One of the Study 19 inclusion criteria was forced vital capacity (FVC) ≥80% of predicted (≥80%p). Therefore, the study provided no information on edaravone efficacy in subjects with FVC <80%p. In Study 19, 24-week, double-blind treatment was followed by open-label treatment where all subjects received edaravone. At 24 weeks, some subjects had FVC <80%p (FVC24 <80%p). This allowed for post-hoc assessment of the effects of edaravone in subgroups of subjects with FVC24 ≥80%p vs <80%p. Objective: To address the question of the efficacy of edaravone in ALS patients with FVC <80%p. Methods: Post-hoc analysis of Study 19 comparing edaravone efficacy at week 48 in subjects with FVC24 ≥80%p vs <80%p. Results: With edaravone treatment, subjects in both the FVC24 ≥80%p and the FVC24 <80%p subgroups experienced a reduction in ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score loss vs placebo subjects through week 48. For the FVC24 ≥80%p subgroup, the changes in ALSFRS-R scores from baseline to week 48 were -7.63 for edaravone-edaravone vs -9.69 for placebo-edaravone, a difference of 2.05 (P = .034; 95% CI: 0.16, 3.94). For the FVC24 <80%p subgroup, the changes in ALSFRS-R scores from baseline to week 48 were -10.26 for edaravone-edaravone vs -15.20 for placebo-edaravone, a difference of 4.94 (P = .0038; 95% CI: 1.64, 8.25). Linear regression analysis indicated that, in the FVC24 <80%p subgroup, there was a notable change in the slope of the ALSFRS-R score-vs-time graph after the start of edaravone treatment. Conclusion: ALS subjects in the Study 19 placebo arm had a slowing in disease progression, even when edaravone was added with an FVC of <80%p prior to starting edaravone. A randomized, placebo-controlled study is needed to validate these post-hoc findings.

Objective: Exercise may be physically and psychologically important for people with ALS, especially in the earlier stages of the disease, and, as a consequence, current ALS clinical management includes individualized rehabilitation as part of multidisciplinary care because. However, while recent studies focused on which type of exercise is more indicated to ALS patients, there is no evidence at which frequency training sessions should be performed. Methods: We performed an assessor blinded randomized clinical trial to investigate the superiority of two different frequencies of exercise on rate of progression in ALS. We enrolled 65 patients in two groups: intensive exercise regimen (IER, five sessions/week) versus usual exercise regimen (UER, two sessions/week). The primary aim was to assess if IER decreased disease progression, measured through Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised, with respect to UER. Secondary aims included assessment of adverse events, tracheostomy-free survival, motor and respiratory functions, fatigue, quality of life and caregiver burden. Treatment regimen consisted for both groups of the same kind of exercise including aerobic training, endurance training, stretching or assisted active mobilization, differing for frequency of intervention. Results: No significant changes in disease progression were found in patients under IER versus UER. At the end of the study, there were no significant differences between the two groups in survival, respiratory function, time to supporting procedures, and quality of life. Adverse events, fatigue, and caregiver burden were not different between the two treatment regimens. Conclusions: Despite some limitations, our trial demonstrated that high-frequency physical exercise was not superior to UER on ALSFRS-R scores, motor and respiratory functions, survival, fatigue, and quality of life of ALS patients.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cortical and spinal motor neuron dysfunction. Routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have previously shown hypointense signal in the motor cortex on T(2)-weighted images in some ALS patients, however, the cause of this finding is unknown. To investigate the utility of this MR signal change as a marker of cortical motor neuron degeneration, signal abnormalities on 3T and 7T MR images of the brain were compared, and pathology was obtained in two ALS patients to determine the origin of the motor cortex hypointensity. Nineteen patients with clinically probable or definite ALS by El Escorial criteria and 19 healthy controls underwent 3T MRI. A 7T MRI scan was carried out on five ALS patients who had motor cortex hypointensity on the 3T FLAIR sequence and on three healthy controls. Postmortem 7T MRI of the brain was performed in one ALS patient and histological studies of the brains and spinal cords were obtained post-mortem in two patients. The motor cortex hypointensity on 3T FLAIR images was present in greater frequency in ALS patients. Increased hypointensity correlated with greater severity of upper motor neuron impairment. Analysis of 7T T(2)(*)-weighted gradient echo imaging localized the signal alteration to the deeper layers of the motor cortex in both ALS patients. Pathological studies showed increased iron accumulation in microglial cells in areas corresponding to the location of the signal changes on the 3T and 7T MRI of the motor cortex. These findings indicate that the motor cortex hypointensity on 3T MRI FLAIR images in ALS is due to increased iron accumulation by microglia. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00334516.

Background: Riluzole is the only drug to prolong survival for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and, at a dose of 100 mg, was associated with a 35% reduction in mortality in a clinical trial. A key question is whether the survival benefit occurs at an early stage of disease, late stage, or is spread throughout the course of the disease. To address this question, we used the King's clinical staging system to do a retrospective analysis of data from the original dose-ranging clinical trial of riluzole. Methods: In the original dose-ranging trial, patients were enrolled between December, 1992, and November, 1993, in Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, Canada, the USA, and the UK if they had probable or definite ALS as defined by the El Escorial criteria. The censor date for the riluzole survival data was set as the original study end date of Dec 31, 1994. For this analysis, King's clinical ALS stage was estimated from the electronic case record data of the modified Norris scale, UK Medical Research Council score for muscle strength, El Escorial category, vital capacity, and gastrostomy insertion data. The lowest allocated stage was 2 because the original trial only included patients with probable or definite ALS. We used a χ2 test to assess the independence of stage at trial enrolment and treatment group, Kaplan-Meier product limit distribution to test the transition from each stage to subsequent stages, and Cox regression to confirm an effect of treatment group on time in stage, controlling for covariates. We did sensitivity analyses by combining treatment groups, using alternative strategies to stage, stratifying by stage at trial enrolment, and using multistate outcome analysis of treatments (MOAT). Findings: We analysed the case records of all 959 participants from the original dose-ranging trial, 237 assigned to 50 mg/day riluzole, 236 to 100 mg/day, 244 to 200 mg/day, and 242 to daily placebo. Clinical stage at enrolment did not significantly differ between treatment groups (p=0·22). Time in stage 4 was longer for patients receiving 100 mg/day riluzole than for those receiving placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0·55, 95% CI 0·36-0·83; log-rank p=0·037). Combining treatment groups and stratifying by stage at enrolment showed a similar result (HR 0·638, 95% CI 0·464-0·878; p=0·006), as did analysis with MOAT where the mean number of days spent in stage 4 was numerically higher for patients given riluzole at higher doses compared with patients receiving placebo. Time from stages 2 or 3 to subsequent stages or death did not differ between riluzole treatment groups and placebo (p=0·83 for stage 2 and 0·88 for stage 3). Interpretation: We showed that riluzole prolongs survival in the last clinical stage of ALS; this finding needs to be confirmed in a prospective study, and treatment effects at stage 1 still need to be analysed. The ALS stage at which benefit occurs is important for counselling of patients before starting treatment. Staging should be used in future ALS clinical trials to assess the stage at which survival benefit occurs, and a similar approach could be used for other neurodegenerative diseases.

Background: Patients with ALS commonly exhibit pseudobulbar affect. Methods: The authors conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel, three-arm study to test a defined combination of dextromethorphan hydrobromide (DM) and quinidine sulfate (Q) (AVP-923) for the treatment of pseudobulbar affect in ALS. Q inhibits the rapid first-pass metabolism of DM. The effects of AVP-923 (30 mg of DM plus 30 mg of Q) given twice daily for 28 days were compared with those of its components. Patients were evaluated on days 1, 15, and 29. The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline in the Center for Neurologic Study Lability Scale (CNS-LS) score. Secondary efficacy variables were laughing/crying episode rates and changes in Visual Analog Scales for Quality of Life (QOL) and Relationships (QOR). Efficacy was evaluated in intention-to-treat subjects who were not poor metabolizers of DM (n = 65 for AVP-923, n = 30 for DM, and n = 34 for Q). Safety was assessed in all randomized subjects (n = 140). Results: AVP-923 patients experienced 3.3-point greater improvements in CNS-LS than DM patients (p = 0.001) and 3.7-point greater improvements than Q patients (p < 0.001). AVP-923 patients exhibited lower overall episode rates, improved QOL scores, and improved QOR scores (p < 0.01 for all endpoints). Adverse effects were mostly mild or moderate; treatment-related discontinuation was 24% for AVP-923, 6% for DM, and 8% for Q. Conclusions: AVP-923 palliates pseudobulbar affect in ALS. Overall benefits of treatment are reflected in fewer episodes of crying and laughing and improvements in overall quality of life and quality of relationships.

Objective: To examine the safety and tolerability as well as the preliminary efficacy of arimoclomol, a heat shock protein co-inducer that promotes nascent protein folding, in patients with rapidly progressive SOD1 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Methods: This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which patients with rapidly progressive SOD1-mutant ALS were randomized 1:1 to receive arimoclomol 200 mg tid or matching placebo for up to 12 months. Study procedures were performed using a mix of in-person and remote assessments. Primary outcome was safety and tolerability. Secondary outcome was efficacy, with survival as the principal measure. Additional efficacy measures were the rates of decline of the Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) and percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 6 seconds (FEV6), and the Combined Assessment of Function and Survival (CAFS). Results: Thirty-eight participants were randomized. Thirty-six (19 placebo, 17 arimoclomol) were included in the prespecified intent-to-treat analysis. Apart from respiratory function, groups were generally well-balanced at baseline. Adverse events occurred infrequently, and were usually mild and deemed unlikely or not related to study drug. Adjusting for riluzole and baseline ALSFRS-R, survival favored arimoclomol with a hazard ratio of 0.77 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32-1.80). ALSFRS-R and FEV6 declined more slowly in the arimoclomol group, with treatment differences of 0.5 point/month (95% CI -0.63 to 1.63) and 1.24 percent predicted/month (95% CI -2.77 to 5.25), respectively, and the CAFS similarly favored arimoclomol. Conclusions: This study provides Class II evidence that arimoclomol is safe and well-tolerated at a dosage of 200 mg tid for up to 12 months. Although not powered for therapeutic effect, the consistency of results across the range of prespecified efficacy outcome measures suggests a possible therapeutic benefit of arimoclomol. Clinicaltrialsgov identifier: NCT00706147. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class II evidence that arimoclomol is safe and well-tolerated at a dosage of 200 mg tid for up to 12 months. The study lacked the precision to conclude, or to exclude, an important therapeutic benefit of arimoclomol. © 2018 The Author(s).

Objective: To determine the effects of resistance exercise on function, fatigue, and quality of life in individuals with ALS. Methods: Subjects with a diagnosis of clinically definite, probable, or laboratory-supported ALS, forced vital capacity (FVC) of 90% predicted or greater, and an ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) score of 30 or greater were randomly assigned to a resistance exercise group that received a home exercise program consisting of daily stretching and resistance exercises three times weekly or to a usual care group, who performed only the daily stretching exercises. ALSFRS, the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and Short Form-36 (SF-36) were completed at baseline and monthly for 6 months. FVC and maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) were monitored monthly throughout the study. Results: Of 33 subjects screened, 27 were randomly assigned (resistance = 13; usual care = 14). Eight resistance exercise subjects and 10 usual care subjects completed the trial. At 6 months, the resistance exercise group had significantly higher ALSFRS and SF-36 physical function subscale scores. No adverse events related to the intervention occurred, MVIC and FVC indicated no negative effects, and less decline in leg strength measured by MVIC was found in the resistance exercise group. Conclusion: Our study, although small, showed that the resistance exercise group had significantly better function, as measured by total ALS Functional Rating Scale and upper and lower extremity subscale scores, and quality of life without adverse effects as compared with subjects receiving usual care.

Motor neuron disorders (MND) include a group of pathologies that affect upper and/or lower motor neurons. Among them, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by progressive muscle weakness, with fatal outcomes only in a few years after diagnosis. On the other hand, primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), a more benign form of MND that only affects upper motor neurons, results in life-long progressive motor dysfunction. Although the outcomes are quite different, ALS and PLS present with similar symptoms at disease onset, to the degree that both disorders could be considered part of a continuum. These similarities and the lack of reliable biomarkers often result in delays in accurate diagnosis and/or treatment. In the nervous system, lipids exert a wide variety of functions, including roles in cell structure, synaptic transmission, and multiple metabolic processes. Thus, the study of the absolute and relative concentrations of a subset of lipids in human pathology can shed light into these cellular processes and unravel alterations in one or more pathways. In here, we report the lipid composition of longitudinal plasma samples from ALS and PLS patients initially, and after 2 years following enrollment in a clinical study. Our analysis revealed common aspects of these pathologies suggesting that, from the lipidomics point of view, PLS and ALS behave as part of a continuum of motor neuron disorders.

Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic yield of magnetic cortical stimulation with the triple stimulation technique (TST) to identify upper motor neuron (UMN) involvement in patients suspected of having ALS. Methods: Fifty-nine patients were recruited to undergo TST in addition to the standard work-up for suspected motor neuron disease. TST combines transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex with collision studies, which results in a higher sensitivity in detecting UMN involvement. Primary outcome was the number of abnormal TST results in patients with possible ALS. The positivity rate was converted to the number needed to test with TST (NN-TST) for one extra diagnosis of ALS. Results: Fifty patients underwent TST. In the total group (n=59), 18 patients had a motor neuron disorder but did not fulfil criteria for 'probable' or 'definite' ALS. In four of these patients TST was abnormal (NN-TST, 4.5). One TST was erroneously interpreted as abnormal. TST findings were normal in inclusion body myositis and peripheral nerve disorders. Conclusion: This prospective and blind study confirms open studies of TST in the evaluation of ALS. We suggest that TST can be used to arrive at a diagnosis of 'probable' or 'definite' ALS in patients lacking UMN signs in the upper extremities.

As the number of potential neuroprotective agents for ALS increases, the need for early phase trials that screen drugs before proceeding to efficacy trials also grows. However, it is not known which outcome measures perform best and also provide the most meaningful information in brief small trials. We assessed the performance of different outcome measures for use in early phase clinical trials in ALS, and determined what degree of change in the ALSFRS-R that patients could perceive. Thirty patients underwent six monthly ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R), forced vital capacity, manual muscle testing (MMT) and quality of life assessments. Patients rated their perceived level of change with algorithm scales. Linear mixed effects models assessed the associations among variables and Cox proportional-hazards models examined the ability to predict survival. The quantity of missing data was assessed using descriptive statistics. Correlations were found between all variables. The ALSFRS-R provided the most complete data (99.5%), showed a large within-subject correlation (0.91), and best predicted survival (p = 0.002). One-unit change in patient-perceived clinical function paralleled a 9-point decrease in the ALSFRS-R (p = 0.025; 95% CI 8, 10). This trial assessed just 30 patients over six months, but the standard outcome measures each performed dependably; all could be used in short-duration, early phase trials. The ALSFRS-R most strongly predicted survival and provided the most complete data, but large changes may be necessary before patients perceive treatment effects.

Background: Minocycline has anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects in vitro, and extends survival in mouse models of some neurological conditions. Several trials are planned or are in progress to assess whether minocycline slows human neurodegeneration. We aimed to test the efficacy of minocycline as a treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Methods: We did a multicentre, randomised placebo-controlled phase III trial. After a 4-month lead-in phase, 412 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or minocycline in escalating doses of up to 400 mg/day for 9 months. The primary outcome measure was the difference in rate of change in the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R). Secondary outcome measures were forced vital capacity (FVC), manual muscle testing (MMT), quality of life, survival, and safety. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00047723. Findings: ALSFRS-R score deterioration was faster in the minocycline group than in the placebo group (-1.30 vs -1.04 units/month, 95% CI for difference -0.44 to -0.08; p=0.005). Patients on minocycline also had non-significant tendencies towards faster decline in FVC (-3.48 vs -3.01, -1.03 to 0.11; p=0.11) and MMT score (-0.30 vs -0.26, -0.08 to 0.01; p=0.11), and greater mortality during the 9-month treatment phase (hazard ratio=1.32, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.10; p=0.23) than did patients on placebo. Quality-of-life scores did not differ between the treatment groups. Non-serious gastrointestinal and neurological adverse events were more common in the minocycline group than in the placebo group, but these events were not significantly related to the decline in ALSFRS-R score. Interpretation: Our finding that minocycline has a harmful effect on patients with ALS has implications for trials of minocycline in patients with other neurological disorders, and for how potential neuroprotective agents are screened for use in patients with ALS.

Background: A study was conducted to: (1) establish the feasibility and reliability of the Spiritual Well-Being Scale (SWBS) and its religious (RWB) and existential well-being (EWB) subscales in a sample of individuals with ALS; (2) describe the spiritual and religious practices, and spiritual well-being in these individuals; and (3) examine the relationship between spiritual well-being and quality of life. Method: A random sample of 60 individuals completed the SWBS at the beginning and end of an ALS clinic visit. Subjects were classified into early, middle or late stage of ALS, using vital capacity and total ALS Functional Rating Scale scores. A subsample completed the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP). Results: The SWBS and its RWB and EWB subscales were found to have high internal consistency and test-retest reliability. There were no statistically significant differences in SWB, RWB or EWB scores among the three stages of ALS. RWB scores were significantly higher than EWB scores overall and within the middle and late stages. Strong negative correlations were found between physical and psychosocial dimension SIP subscores and RWB scores, suggesting that religious well-being may impact quality of life, or vice versa.

To evaluate safety, dose response, and preliminary efficacy of reldesemtiv over 12 weeks in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Methods: Patients (≤2 years since diagnosis) with slow upright vital capacity (SVC) of ≥60% were randomized 1:1:1:1 to reldesemtiv 150, 300, or 450 mg twice daily (bid) or placebo; active treatment was 12 weeks with 4-week follow-up. Primary endpoint was change in percent predicted SVC at 12 weeks; secondary measures included ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) and muscle strength mega-score. Results: Patients (N = 458) were enrolled; 85% completed 12-week treatment. The primary analysis failed to reach statistical significance (p = 0.11); secondary endpoints showed no statistically significant effects (ALSFRS-R, p = 0.09; muscle strength mega-score, p = 0.31). Post hoc analyses pooling all active reldesemtiv-treated patients compared against placebo showed trends toward benefit in all endpoints (progression rate for SVC, ALSFRS-R, and muscle strength mega-score (nominal p values of 0.10, 0.01 and 0.20 respectively)). Reldesemtiv was well tolerated, with nausea and fatigue being the most common side effects. A dose-dependent decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate was noted, and transaminase elevations were seen in approximately 5% of patients. Both hepatic and renal abnormalities trended toward resolution after study drug discontinuation. Conclusions: Although the primary efficacy analysis did not demonstrate statistical significance, there were trends favoring reldesemtiv for all three endpoints, with effect sizes generally regarded as clinically important. Tolerability was good; modest hepatic and renal abnormalities were reversible. The impact of reldesemtiv on patients with ALS should be assessed in a pivotal Phase 3 trial.

The neurite outgrowth inhibitor, Nogo-A, has been shown to be overexpressed in skeletal muscle in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); it is both a potential biomarker and therapeutic target. We performed a double-blind, two-part, dose-escalation study, in subjects with ALS, assessing safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and functional effects of ozanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against Nogo-A. In Part 1, 40 subjects were randomized (3∶1) to receive single dose intravenous ozanezumab (0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, or 15 mg/kg) or placebo. In Part 2, 36 subjects were randomized (3∶1) to receive two repeat doses of intravenous ozanezumab (0.5, 2.5, or 15 mg/kg) or placebo, approximately 4 weeks apart. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability (adverse events [AEs], vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests). Secondary endpoints included PK, immunogenicity, functional endpoints (clinical and electrophysiological), and biomarker parameters. Overall, ozanezumab treatment (0.01-15 mg/kg) was well tolerated. The overall incidence of AEs in the repeat dose 2.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg ozanezumab groups was higher than in the repeat dose placebo group and repeat dose 0.5 mg/kg ozanezumab group. The majority were considered not related to study drug by the investigators. Six serious AEs were reported in three subjects receiving ozanezumab; none were considered related to study drug. No study drug-related patterns were identified for ECG, laboratory, or vital signs parameters. One subject (repeat dose 15 mg/kg ozanezumab) showed a weak, positive anti-ozanezumab-antibody result. PK results were generally consistent with monoclonal antibody treatments. No apparent treatment effects were observed for functional endpoints or muscle biomarkers. Immunohistochemical staining showed dose-dependent co-localization of ozanezumab with Nogo-A in skeletal muscle. In conclusion, single and repeat dose ozanezumab treatment was well tolerated and demonstrated co-localization at the site of action. These findings support future studies with ozanezumab in ALS.

In patients with various types of chronic motor denervation, the numbers of surviving motor units have been compared with the twitch tensions developed by the same muscle (extensor digitorum brevis). It was found that functional compensation in partially denervated muscles was often marked; in most patients abnormally small twitches occurred only when fewer than 10% of motor axons remained. The factors responsible for this compensation are considered. The twitch speeds of partially denervated muscles differed markedly, even among patients with the same disorder; there was evidence to suggest that the twitches of some motor units might become slower than those found in normal muscles.

Background: Nutritional status is an important prognostic factor in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). We wished to study the safety, tolerability and efficacy of nutritional counseling with or without an mHealth application to maintain or increase body weight in ALS, compared to standard care. Methods: In this randomized open-label, standard-of-care-controlled, single-center clinical trial, we randomly assigned adults with ALS to one of three nutritional interventions: counseling by their physician or nurse (""standard care""), counseling by a registered dietitian (RD) (""in-person""), or counseling supported by a mHealth app (""mHealth""). Both intervention arms received tailored nutrition recommendations and recorded dietary intake and weight biweekly (mHealth) or monthly (in-person). The primary outcome of weight and secondary and tertiary outcomes of calorie intake, ALSFRS-R, and quality of life (QOL) were recorded at each clinic visit and analyzed in an ITT mixed model analysis. Results: A total of 88 participants were enrolled of whom 78 were included in this analysis. The three arms were well-balanced except for excess males in the mHealth arm and greater weight lost at baseline in the in-person arm. Participants in the mHealth arm increased their calorie intake at month 3 to an average of 94% (95% CI: 85, 103) of recommended calories, compared to 81% (95% CI: 72, 91, p = 0.06 vs. mHealth) in the standard care arm. After 6 months, calorie intake was not different among the three arms. Overall weight was stable across all three groups. QOL scores in the mHealth arm were stable over 3 months (0.3 points, 95% CI: - 1.7, 2.2) compared to worsening in standard care (- 2.1 points, 95% CI: - 4.0, - 0.2, p = 0.09 vs. mHealth), but all scores declined by 6 months. ALSFRS-R total scores declined by an average of - 2.6 points (95% CI: - 5.1, - 0.1) over 6 months in the mHealth arm (p = 0.13 vs. standard care) compared to - 5.8 points (95% CI: - 8.2, - 3.4, p = 0.74 vs. standard care) in the in-person and - 5.2 points (95% CI: - 7.6, - 2.9) in the standard care arm. Conclusions: Nutritional counseling by a registered dietitian (with or without support by an mHealth app) is safe but did not maintain weight significantly better than standard care in ALS patients.

Background: In a pilot study, lithium treatment slowed progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We aimed to confirm or disprove these findings by assessing the safety and efficacy of lithium in combination with riluzole in patients with ALS. Methods: We did a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a time-to-event design. Between January and June, 2009, patients with ALS who were taking a stable dose of riluzole for at least 30 days were randomly assigned (1:1) by a centralised computer to receive either lithium or placebo. Patients, caregivers, investigators, and all site study staff with the exception of site pharmacists were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was the time to an event, defined as a decrease of at least six points on the revised ALS functional rating scale score or death. Interim analyses were planned for when 84 patients had been allocated treatment, 6 months later or after 55 events, and after 100 events. Analysis was by intention to treat. The stopping boundary for futility at the first interim analysis was a p value of at least 0.68. We used a log-rank test to compare the distributions of the time to an event between the lithium and placebo groups. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00818389. Findings: At the first interim analysis, 22 of 40 patients in the lithium group had an event compared with 20 of 44 patients in the placebo group (log rank p=0.51). The hazard ratio of reaching the primary endpoint was 1.13 (95% CI 0.61-2.07). The study was stopped at the first interim analysis because criterion for futility was met (p=0.78). The difference in mean decline in the ALS functional rating scale score between the lithium group and the placebo group was 0.15 (95% CI -0.43 to 0.73, p=0.61). There were no major safety concerns. Falls (p=0.04) and back pain (p=0.05) were more common in the lithium group than in the placebo group. Interpretation: We found no evidence that lithium in combination with riluzole slows progression of ALS more than riluzole alone. The time-to-event endpoint and use of prespecified interim analyses enabled a clear result to be obtained rapidly. This design should be considered for future trials testing the therapeutic efficacy of drugs that are easily accessible to people with ALS.

Objective: To identify factors associated with tolerance and survival after noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and to investigate the influence of NIPPV on lung function in patients with ALS. Methods: NIPPV was offered to 71 patients with ALS in accordance with currently published guidelines. Effects of NIPPV on lung function and factors influencing tolerance and survival after NIPPV were studied. Results: Forty-four patients (61.9%; 95% CI: 50.6 to 73.2) tolerated NIPPV (NIPPV use >or=4 h/day) and 27 (38.1%; 95% CI: 26.8 to 49.4) were intolerant (NIPPV use <4 h/day). Patients with mild or moderate bulbar symptoms were more likely to tolerate NIPPV than those with severe impairment (odds ratio = 6.09, 95% CI: 1.18 to 31.52, p = 0.031). After NIPPV introduction, a slower decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) was observed in tolerant vs intolerant patients (p = 0.002). The slope of FVC decline after NIPPV initiation (risk ratio [RR]: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.94, p = 0.01) together with NIPPV tolerance (RR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.78, p = 0.013) were the only independent predictors of survival in the overall group of patients. In multivariate analysis, body mass index was the most powerful predictor of longer survival after NIPPV in tolerant patients (RR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.61 to 0.96, p = 0.022). Conclusion: Survival after noninvasive ventilation was independently related to ventilatory use (>or=4 h/day) and to the modifications of forced vital capacity decline after treatment initiation. The severity of bulbar impairment and the nutritional status of the ALS patients at the introduction of ventilation may predict tolerance and survival.

Background: Neurite outgrowth inhibitor A (Nogo-A) is thought to have a role in the pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A monoclonal antibody against Nogo-A showed a positive effect in the SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS, and a humanised form of this antibody (ozanezumab) was well tolerated in a first-in-human trial. Therefore, we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of ozanezumab in patients with ALS. Methods: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial was done in 34 centres in 11 countries. Patients aged 18-80 years with a diagnosis of familial or sporadic ALS were randomly assigned (1:1), centrally according to a computer-generated allocation schedule, to receive ozanezumab (15 mg/kg) or placebo as intravenous infusions over 1 h every 2 weeks for 46 weeks, followed by assessments at week 48 and week 60. Patients and study personnel were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was a joint-rank analysis of function (ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised) and overall survival, analysed at 48 weeks in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01753076, and with GSK-ClinicalStudyRegister.com, NOG112264, and is completed. Findings: Between Dec 20, 2012, and Nov 1, 2013, we recruited 307 patients, of whom 303 were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n=151) or ozanezumab (n=152). The adjusted mean of the joint-rank score was -14·9 (SE 13·5) for the ozanezumab group and 15·0 (13·6) for the placebo group, with a least squares mean difference of -30·0 (95% CI -67·9 to 7·9; p=0·12). Overall, reported adverse events, serious adverse events, and adverse events leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug or withdrawal from study were similar between the treatment groups, except for dyspepsia (ten [7%] in the ozanezumab group vs four [3%] in the placebo group), depression (11 [7%] vs five [3%]), and diarrhoea (25 [16%] vs 12 [8%]). Respiratory failure was the most common serious adverse event (12 [8%] vs seven [5%]). At week 60, the number of deaths was higher in the ozanezumab group (20 [13%]) than in the placebo group (16 [11%]), mainly as a result of respiratory failure (ten [7%] vs five [3%]). Two deaths were considered related to the study drug (bladder transitional cell carcinoma in the ozanezumab group and cerebrovascular accident in the placebo group). Interpretation: Ozanezumab did not show efficacy compared with placebo in patients with ALS. Therefore, Nogo-A does not seem to be an effective therapeutic target in ALS. Funding: GlaxoSmithKline.

Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with respiratory muscle weakness and respiratory failure. Non-invasive ventilation alleviates respiratory symptoms and prolongs life, but is a palliative intervention. Slowing the deterioration of diaphragm function before respiratory failure would be desirable. We aimed to assess whether early diaphragm pacing could slow down diaphragm deterioration and would therefore delay the need for non-invasive ventilation. Methods: We did a multicentre, randomised, controlled, triple-blind trial in patients with probable or definite ALS in 12 ALS centres in France. The main inclusion criterion was moderate respiratory involvement (forced vital capacity 60-80% predicted). Other key eligibility criteria were age older than 18 years and bilateral responses of the diaphragm to diagnostic phrenic stimulation. All patients were operated laparoscopically and received phrenic stimulators. Clinicians randomly assigned patients (1:1) to receive either active or sham stimulation with a central web-based randomisation system (computer-generated list). Investigators, patients, and an external outcome allocation committee were masked to treatment. The primary outcome was non-invasive ventilation-free survival, analysed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety outcomes were also assessed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01583088. Findings: Between Sept 27, 2012, and July 8, 2015, 74 participants were randomly assigned to receive either active (n=37) or sham (n=37) stimulation. On July 16, 2015, an unplanned masked analysis was done after another trial showed excess mortality with diaphragm pacing in patients with hypoventilation (DiPALS, ISRCTN 53817913). In view of this finding, we analysed mortality in our study and found excess mortality (death from any cause) in our active stimulation group. We therefore terminated the study on July, 16, 2015. Median non-invasive ventilation-free survival was 6·0 months (95% CI 3·6-8·7) in the active stimulation group versus 8·8 months (4·2-not reached) in the control (sham stimulation) group (hazard ratio 1·96 [95% CI 1·08-3·56], p=0·02). Serious adverse events (mainly capnothorax or pneumothorax, acute respiratory failure, venous thromboembolism, and gastrostomy) were frequent (24 [65%] patients in the active stimulation group vs 22 [59%] patients in the control group). No treatment-related death was reported. Interpretation: Early diaphragm pacing in patients with ALS and incipient respiratory involvement did not delay non-invasive ventilation and was associated with decreased survival. Diaphragm pacing is not indicated at the early stage of the ALS-related respiratory involvement.

Our objective was to compare the phase II and phase III (EMPOWER) studies of dexpramipexole in ALS and evaluate potential EMPOWER responder subgroups and biomarkers based on significant inter-study population differences. In a post hoc analysis, we compared the baseline population characteristics of both dexpramipexole studies and analyzed EMPOWER efficacy outcomes and laboratory measures in subgroups defined by significant inter-study differences. Results showed that, compared with phase II, the proportion of El Escorial criteria (EEC) definite participants decreased (p = 0.005), riluzole use increased (p = 0.002), and mean symptom duration increased (p = 0.037) significantly in EMPOWER. Baseline creatinine (p < 0.001) and on-study creatinine change (p < 0.001) correlated significantly with ALSFRS-R in EMPOWER. In the EMPOWER subgroup defined by EEC-definite ALS, riluzole use, and < median symptom duration (15.3 months), dexpramipexole-treated participants had reduced ALSFRS-R slope decline (p = 0.015), decreased mortality (p = 0.011), and reduced creatinine loss (p = 0.003). In conclusion, significant differences existed between the phase II and EMPOWER study populations in ALS clinical trials of dexpramipexole. In a post hoc analysis of EMPOWER subgroups defined by these differences, potential clinical benefits of dexpramipexole were identified in the subgroup of riluzole-treated, short-symptom duration, EEC-definite ALS participants. Creatinine loss correlated with disease progression and was reduced in dexpramipexole-treated participants, suggesting it as a candidate biomarker.

Neuronal loss, synaptic disconnection and neuritic sprouting correlate with dementia in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nitric oxide (NO) is an important synaptic plasticity molecule generated by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) oxidation of a guanidino nitrogen of L-arginine. Experimentally, the NOS III gene is modulated with neuritic sprouting. In a previous study, NOS III expression was found to be abnormal in cortical neurons, white matter glial cells, and dystrophic neurites in AD and Down syndrome brains. The present study demonstrates the same abnormalities in neuronal and glial NOS III expression with massive proliferation of NOS III-immunoreactive neurites and glial cell processes in other neurodegenerative diseases including: diffuse Lewy body disease, Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple system atrophy, and Parkinson's disease. However, each disease, including AD, was distinguished by the selective alterations in NOS III expression and sprouting in structures marred by neurodegeneration. Double label immunohistochemical staining studies demonstrated nitrotyrosine and NOS III co-localized in only rare neurons and neuritic sprouts, suggesting that peroxynitrite formation and nitration of growth cone proteins may not be important consequences of NOS III enzyme accumulation. The results suggest that aberrant NOS III expression and NOS III-associated neuritic sprouting in the CNS are major abnormalities common to several important neurodegenerative diseases.

Accurate patient stratification into prognostic categories and targeting Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)-associated pathways may pave the way for promising trials. We evaluated blood-based prognostic indicators using an array of pathological markers. Plasma samples were collected as part of a large, phase III clinical trial (Mitotarget/TRO19622) at months 1, 6, 12 and 18. The ALSFRS-r score was used as a proxy of disease progression to assess the predictive value of candidate biological indicators. First, established clinical predictors were evaluated in all 512 patients. Subsequently, pathologic markers, such as proxies of neuronal integrity (Neurofilament light chain and phosphorylated heavy chain), DNA oxidation (8-oxo-2'-desoxyguanosine), lipid peroxidation (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, isoprostane), inflammation (interleukin-6) and iron status (ferritin, hepcidin, transferrin) were assessed in a subset of 109 patients that represented the whole cohort. Markers of neuronal integrity, DNA and lipid oxidation, as well as iron status at baseline are accurate predictors of disability at 18-month follow-up. The composite scores of these markers in association with established clinical predictors enable the accurate forecasting of functional decline. The identified four biomarkers are all closely associated with 'ferroptosis', a recently discovered form of programmed cell death with promising therapeutic targets. The predictive potential of these pathophysiology-based indicators may offer superior patient stratification for future trials, individualised patient care and resource allocation.

F responses were recorded in 6 cases with SSP and in 22 normal controls. The present study confirmed that frequency, number of phases, F/M amplitude ratio and duration were significantly increased and CV of onset latencies was significantly reduced in cases with SSP. After intravenous injection of TRH (2 mg), all the parameters were altered toward normal sides. It was suggested that the hyperexcitability of motor neuron pool in SSP was stabilized by effects of TRH on injured pyramidal tracts and consequently abnormalities of F responses were improved. The Effect of TRH to correct the abnormal F responses in SSP might be consistent with effects of TRH to reduce spasticity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis described previously.

Repetitive discharges (RDs) are observed in electromyograms recorded from healthy as well as diseased muscles. We have evaluated the prevalence of RDs in some neuromuscular diseases and analysed the time parameters of recordings displaying RDs as well as shapes of the potentials. In our clinical material, RDs have been observed exclusively in lower motor neuron lesions, never in healthy or in myopathic muscles. The prevalence index of RDs in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (0.06) was found to be different from that in chronic spinal muscle atrophy (0.004). The types of double potential shape have been categorised. The relationships between the amplitude of the second component and the interspike duration and that between the interspike duration and the jitter were calculated. The amplitude of the second component diminished and jitter of the components increased with the shortening of the interval between components. The authors suggest that in lower motor neuron lesions, the RDs of the motorunit (MU) may be one of the first signs of the MU's dysfunction.

Importance: Preclinical studies have shown that neurotrophic growth factors (NTFs) extend the survival of motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and that the combined delivery of these neurotrophic factors has a strong synergistic effect. We have developed a culture-based method for inducing mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to secrete neurotrophic factors. These MSC-NTF cells have been shown to be protective in several animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. Objective: To determine the safety and possible clinical efficacy of autologous MSC-NTF cells transplantation in patients with ALS. Design, setting, and participants: In these open-label proof-of-concept studies, patients with ALS were enrolled between June 2011 and October 2014 at the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, Israel. All patients were followed up for 3 months before transplantation and 6 months after transplantation. In the phase 1/2 part of the trial, 6 patients with early-stage ALS were injected intramuscularly (IM) and 6 patients with more advanced disease were transplanted intrathecally (IT). In the second stage, a phase 2a dose-escalating study, 14 patients with early-stage ALS received a combined IM and IT transplantation of autologous MSC-NTF cells. Interventions: Patients were administered a single dose of MSC-NTF cells. Main outcomes and measures: The primary end points of the studies were safety and tolerability of this cell therapy. Secondary end points included the effects of the treatment on various clinical parameters, such as the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised score and the respiratory function. Results: Among the 12 patients in the phase 1/2 trial and the 14 patients in the phase 2a trial aged 20 and 75 years, the treatment was found to be safe and well tolerated over the study follow-up period. Most of the adverse effects were mild and transient, not including any treatment-related serious adverse event. The rate of progression of the forced vital capacity and of the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised score in the IT (or IT+IM)-treated patients was reduced (from -5.1% to -1.2%/month percentage predicted forced vital capacity, P < .04 and from -1.2 to 0.6 ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised points/month, P = .052) during the 6 months following MSC-NTF cell transplantation vs the pretreatment period. Of these patients, 13 (87%) were defined as responders to either ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised or forced vital capacity, having at least 25% improvement at 6 months after treatment in the slope of progression. Conclusions and relevance: The results suggest that IT and IM administration of MSC-NTF cells in patients with ALS is safe and provide indications of possible clinical benefits, to be confirmed in upcoming clinical trials.

The results of the various studies and an analysis of the methodology are presented in TABLE 1. As can be seen, there was no ""perfect"" study. In five of the studies enough information was presented with regard to the measurements and the behavior of control patients that a statistical analysis could be performed. Three of the studies showed a transient, statistically significant effect in at least some muscles. The two studies that demonstrated no such effect both used TRH in very small doses. It therefore seems reasonable to conclude that the effect of TRH in ALS is a definite, acute, and transient response. The cause of this response, however, has not been documented, and whether it is associated with an effect of the drug on the disease process remains to be seen.

Purpose: The safety and efficacy of intravenous edaravone, a neuroprotectant used for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), have been shown in clinical trials. An oral suspension of edaravone has been developed, but the food effect on its pharmacokinetic profile has not been evaluated. This study aimed to assess the food effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of edaravone after oral administration and to investigate dosing regimens and administration instructions with different meal intake and timing. Methods: Data from 3 Phase I clinical studies were used to evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetic profiles of a single dose of edaravone oral suspension. In all 3 studies, participants received a single dose of edaravone with various meal conditions. Healthy Japanese adult male participants (Studies 1, 2, and 3) or female participants (Study 3) aged 20 to 45 years at the time of informed consent were included. Findings: In Study 1, 6 participants were enrolled and 5 completed the study. Nine and 16 participants were treated in Studies 2 and 3, respectively, and all completed the study. The Cmax and AUC0-∞ of edaravone were lower when administered 30 minutes after a high-fat meal compared with those in a fasted condition (Study 1). Lower plasma edaravone concentrations (approximately within the first hour) and subsequent lower Cmax and AUC0-∞ were observed after administration of edaravone 4 hours after a high-fat meal (Study 2) or 2 hours after a low-fat meal (Study 3). The Cmax and AUC0-∞ of oral edaravone were generally similar and not affected when administered 8 hours after a high-fat meal, 4 hours after a low-fat meal, or 2 hours after a light meal relative to the fasted condition. Administration of edaravone 1 hour before a high-fat meal resulted in no effect on Cmax or AUC0-∞ relative to the fasted condition. Administration of edaravone in the fed or fasted conditions resulted in a similar urine pharmacokinetic profile. Implications: Oral administration of edaravone with a meal decreased the plasma concentration of edaravone. Oral administration of edaravone 8 hours after a high-fat meal, 4 hours after a low-fat meal, 2 hours after a light meal, and 1 hour before a high-fat meal showed no effect of food on the PK profile of unchanged edaravone compared with that observed under a fasted condition.

Background: The ""hospital-at-home"" model may provide adequate care without an adverse effect on clinical outcome, and is generally well received by users. Our objective was to compare hospital-at-home and in-patient hospital care for neuromuscular disease (NMD) patients with respiratory tract infections. Methods: We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial in a university teaching hospital offering secondary care service to a population of approximately 500,000. We recruited selected NMD patients with respiratory tract infection for whom hospital admission had been recommended after medical assessment. Hospital-at-home was provided as an alternative to in-patient admission. The main outcome measures were need for hospitalization, treatment failure, time to recovery, death during the first 3 months following exacerbation, and cost of patient care. Results: Among 59 consecutive NMD patients eligible for the study, 53 met the criteria for hospital-at-home. Twenty-six subjects were randomized to home care and 27 to hospital care. No significant differences were found in treatment failure (8/26 vs 13/27, P = .19), time to recovery (8.9 ± 4.6 vs 9 ± 8.9 d, P = .21), or mortality at 3 months (3/26 vs 4/27 deaths, P = .42) between the groups. Hospital-at-home failure was independently correlated with type of NMD (P = .004) with an odds ratio of failure of 17.3 (95% CI 2.1 to infinity) for subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The total and daily direct cost of patient healthcare was significantly lower for the subjects who were successfully treated at home, compared to the hospitalized individuals. Conclusions: Hospital-at-home is an effective alternative to hospital admission for selected NMD patients with respiratory tract infections.

Our objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of tirasemtiv over 12 weeks and its effect on the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) and other secondary functional measures. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled adults with ALS and slow vital capacity (SVC) > 50% from 73 centers in eight countries. Patients who tolerated open-label tirasemtiv 125 mg b.i.d. for one week were randomized to double-blind treatment either to placebo or tirasemtiv, escalating to a maximum tolerated dose up to 250 mg b.i.d. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in ALSFRS-R; secondary endpoints included SVC, maximum voluntary ventilation, sniff nasal inspiratory pressure, isometric muscle strength, and sub-maximum handgrip fatigue. Of 711 patients enrolled, 596 were randomized and received at least one dose of double-blind treatment. The primary endpoint showed no treatment effect (tirasemtiv: -2.98 ± 0.28, placebo: -2.40 ± 0.25, p = 0.114); however, SVC and muscle strength declined significantly more slowly on tirasemtiv (95% CI p = 0.0006, p = 0.0158, respectively). Dropouts and serious adverse events occurred more frequently in the tirasemtiv group. In conclusion, this was a negative study with respect to the primary endpoint; however, the effects on SVC and muscle strength suggest a potentially important effect of tirasemtiv warranting further evaluation over a longer period in ALS.

Background: In a previous phase 3 study in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), edaravone did not show a significant difference in the Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) score compared with placebo. Post-hoc analysis of these data revealed that patients in an early stage with definite or probable diagnosis of ALS, defined by the revised El Escorial criteria, who met a select set of inclusion criteria showed a greater magnitude of effect than did the full study population. We aimed to substantiate this post-hoc result and assess safety and efficacy of edaravone in a phase 3 trial that focused on patients with early stage ALS who met the post-hoc analysis inclusion criteria. Methods: In this phase 3, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study, patients aged 20-75 years with ALS of grade 1 or 2 in the Japan ALS Severity Classification, scores of at least 2 points on all 12 items of ALSFRS-R, forced vital capacity of 80% or more, definite or probable ALS according to the revised El Escorial criteria, and disease duration of 2 years or less were recruited from 31 hospitals in Japan. Eligible patients also had a decrease of 1-4 points in the ALSFRS-R score during a 12-week observation period before randomisation. Patients meeting all criteria were then randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 60 mg intravenous edaravone or intravenous saline placebo for 6 cycles (4 weeks per cycle with 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off) for a total treatment duration of 24 weeks. In cycle 1, the study drug or placebo was administered once per day for 14 days within a 14 day period, followed by the drug-free period. In cycle 2 and thereafter, the study drug or placebo was administered for 10 days within a 14 day period, followed by a 2 week drug-free period. Participants and investigators, including those assessing outcomes, were masked to treatment allocation. The primary efficacy outcome was the change in ALSFRS-R score from the baseline to 24 weeks (or at discontinuation if this was after the third cycle) after randomisation. The primary outcome was assessed in all patients who had received at least one treatment infusion, had at least one assessment post-baseline, and reached the end of cycle 3. For patients with missing values at the end of cycle 6, data were imputed by the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method, provided the patients had completed at least cycle 3. Safety was assessed in all patients who had received at least one treatment infusion and had at least one assessment post-baseline. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01492686. Findings: Between Nov 28, 2011, and Sept 3, 2014, we screened 213 patients, and enrolled 192 as potential participants. Of these, 137 patients completed the observation period: 69 were randomly assigned to receive edaravone, and 68 were randomly assigned to receive placebo. 68 patients taking edaravone and 66 taking placebo were included in the primary efficacy analysis. For the primary outcome, the change in ALSFRS-R score was -5·01 (SE 0·64) in the edavarone group and -7·50 (0·66) in the placebo group. The least-squares mean difference between groups was 2·49 (SE 0·76, 95% CI 0·99-3·98; p=0·0013) in favour of edaravone. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 58 (84%) patients receiving edaravone and 57 (84%) patients receiving placebo. 11 (16%) patients taking edaravone and 16 (24%) taking placebo had serious adverse events, and one (1%) patient receiving edaravone and four (6%) patients receiving placebo had adverse events (one dysphagia in edaravone group and one dyspnoea, two respiratory disorder, and one rash in the placebo group) that led to withdrawal. Interpretation: Edaravone showed efficacy in a small subset of people with ALS who met criteria identified in post-hoc analysis of a previous phase 3 study, showing a significantly smaller decline of ALSFRS-R score compared with placebo. There is no indication that edaravone might be effective in a wider population of patients with ALS who do not meet the criteria. Funding: Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation.

The objective of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of recombinant human insulinlike growth factor-I (rhIGF-I) in the treatment of sporadic ALS. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study of 266 patients was conducted at eight centers in North America. Placebo or rhIGF-I (0.05 mg/kg/day or 0.10 mg/kg/day) was administered for 9 months. The primary outcome measure was disease symptom progression, assessed by the rate of change (per patient slope) in the Appel ALS rating scale total score. The Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), a patient-perceived, health-related quality of life assessment, was a secondary outcome variable. Progression of functional impairment in patients receiving high-dose (0.10 mg/kg/day) rhIGF-I was 26% slower than in patients receiving placebo (p = 0.01). The high-dose treatment group was less likely to terminate the study due to protocol-defined markers of disease symptom progression, and members in this group exhibited a slower decline in quality of life, as assessed by the SIP. Patients receiving 0.05 mg/kg/day of rhIGF-I exhibited trends similar to those associated with high-dose treatment, suggesting a dose-dependent response. The incidence of clinically significant adverse experiences was comparable among the three treatment groups. Recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-I slowed the progression of functional impairment and the decline in health-related quality of life in patients with ALS with no medically important adverse effects.

Our objective was to determine whether serum urate predicts ALS progression. A study population comprised adult participants of EMPOWER (n = 942), a phase III clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of dexpramipexole to treat ALS. Urate was measured in blood samples collected during enrollment as part of the routine block chemistry. We measured outcomes by combined assessment of function and survival rank (CAFs), and time to death, by 12 months. Results showed that in females there was not a significant relation between urate and outcomes. In males, outcomes improved with increasing urate (comparing highest to lowest urate quartile: CAFS was 53 points better with p for trend = 0.04; and hazard ratio for death was 0.60 with p for trend = 0.07), but with adjustment for body mass index (BMI) at baseline, a predictor of both urate levels and prognosis, associations were attenuated and no longer statistically significant. Overall, participants with urate levels equal to or above the median (5.1 mg/dl) appeared to have a survival advantage compared to those below (hazard ratio adjusted for BMI: 0.67; 95% confidence interval 0.47-0.95). In conclusion, these findings suggest that while the association between urate at baseline and ALS progression is partially explained by BMI, there may be an independent beneficial effect of urate.

In a double-blind study, patients were randomly selected for treatment using conventional doses (CD; 50 mg) or high doses (HD; 150 mg) of sodium aurothiomalate given weekly by injection. Twenty-three patients were assigned to the CD group and 24 to the HD group. Neither efficacy nor toxicity correlated with serum gold concentrations. Conventional doses were as efficacious as high doses with respect to both rapidity and degree of response. However, side effects were much more frequent and severe in the HD group. Thus there is no reason to recommend a 150 mg weekly dosage regimen.

Although the brain enables us to perceive the external world and our body, it remains unknown whether brain processes themselves can be perceived. Brain tissue does not have receptors for its own activity. However, the ability of humans to acquire self-control of brain processes indicates that the perception of these processes may also be achieved by learning. In this study patients learned to control low-frequency components of their EEG: the so-called slow cortical potentials (SCPs). In particular ""probe"" sessions, the patients estimated the quality of the SCP shift they had produced in the preceding trial. The correspondence between the recorded SCP amplitudes and the subjective estimates increased with training. The ability to perceive the SCPs was related to the ability to control them; this perception was not mediated by peripheral variables such as changes in muscle tonus and cannot be reduced to simple vigilance monitoring. These data provide evidence that humans can learn to perceive the neural activity of their brain. Alternative interpretations are discussed. Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

A method for quantifying shape variability, the jiggle, or motor unit potentials (MUPs) recorded with conventional EMG electrodes is presented. Amplitude variability at each point of time of the MUP was analyzed. Two new parameters are proposed: the normalized value of the consecutive amplitude differences (CAD), and the cross-correlational coefficient of the consecutive discharges (CCC). Simulations showed that increased jitter of the constituent single fiber potentials increases the jiggle as expressed by an increase in CAD and decrease in CCC values. Even when the jitter value of each component was fixed, increased temporal dispersion increased the jiggle whereas an increased number of fibers decreased the jiggle. This new method has been applied in normal subjects, patients with chronic neurogenic diseases and patients with ALS. Jiggle was significantly increased in the ALS group, in agreement with visual observations. We believe that this method for quantifying jiggle will increase the information obtainable from routine EMG investigations.

Plasma exchange is a process in which large volumes of plasma, usually equivalent to one plasma volume, are exchanged with donor plasma or a plasma substitute. This permits the removal of antibody, immune complexes, inflammatory mediators, paraproteins, drugs, toxins, and other plasma constituents. Plasma exchange may also have an effect on the immune system by enhancing the function of the reticuloendothelial system, removing blocking antibody, increasing clearance of tumor cells, and making lymphocytes more vulnerable to immunosuppressive drugs. Over 100 diseases have been treated with plasma exchange with variable success. Results of controlled studies are less dramatic than those of earlier uncontrolled case reports. Reports of complications and even death have tempered initial enthusiasm. Now, over a decade since the initial promising reports began to appear in the literature, the role of plasma exchange remains undefined.

Background and objectives: In a phase 1 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) study, autologous infusions of expanded regulatory T-lymphocytes (Tregs) combined with subcutaneous interleukin (IL)-2 were safe and well tolerated. Treg suppressive function increased and disease progression stabilized during the study. The present study was conducted to confirm the reliability of these results. Methods: Participants with ALS underwent leukapheresis, and their Tregs were isolated and expanded in a current Good Manufacturing Practice facility. Seven participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive Treg infusions (1 × 106 cells/kg) IV every 4 weeks and IL-2 (2 × 105 IU/m2) injections 3 times/wk or matching placebo in a 24-week randomized controlled trial (RCT). Six participants proceeded into a 24-week dose-escalation open-label extension (OLE). Two additional participants entered directly into the OLE. The OLE included dose escalation of Treg infusions to 2 × 106 cells/kg and 3 × 106 cells/kg at 4-week intervals. Results: The Treg/IL-2 treatments were safe and well tolerated, and Treg suppressive function was higher in the active group of the RCT. A meaningful evaluation of progression rates in the RCT between the placebo and active groups was not possible due to the limited number of enrolled participants aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the 24-week OLE, the Treg/IL-2 treatments were also safe and well tolerated in 8 participants who completed the escalating doses. Treg suppressive function and numbers were increased compared with baseline. Six of 8 participants changed by an average of -2.7 points per the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised, whereas the other 2 changed by an average of -10.5 points. Elevated levels of 2 markers of peripheral inflammation (IL-17C and IL-17F) and 2 markers of oxidative stress (oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 and oxidized LDL) were present in the 2 rapidly progressing participants but not in the slower progressing group. Discussion: Treg/IL-2 treatments were safe and well tolerated in the RCT and OLE with higher Treg suppressive function. During the OLE, 6 of 8 participants showed slow to no progression. The 2 of 8 rapid progressors had elevated markers of oxidative stress and inflammation, which may help delineate responsiveness to therapy. Whether Treg/IL-2 treatments can slow disease progression requires a larger clinical study (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04055623). Classification of evidence: This study provides Class IV evidence that Treg infusions and IL-2 injections are safe and effective for patients with ALS. Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

Objective: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating, and currently incurable, neuromuscular disease in which oxidative stress and mitochondrial impairment are contributing to neuronal loss. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), an antioxidant and mitochondrial cofactor, has shown promise in ALS transgenic mice, and in clinical trials for neurodegenerative diseases other than ALS. Our aims were to choose between two high doses of CoQ10 for ALS, and to determine if it merits testing in a Phase III clinical trial. Methods: We designed and implemented a multicenter trial with an adaptive, two-stage, bias-adjusted, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, Phase II design (n = 185). The primary outcome in both stages was a decline in the ALS Functional Rating Scale-revised (ALSFRSr) score over 9 months. Stage 1 (dose selection, 35 participants per group) compared CoQ10 doses of 1,800 and 2,700 mg/day. Stage 2 (futility test, 75 patients per group) compared the dose selected in Stage 1 against placebo. Results: Stage 1 selected the 2,700 mg dose. In Stage 2, the pre-specified primary null hypothesis that this dose is superior to placebo was not rejected. It was rejected, however, in an accompanying prespecified sensitivity test, and further supplementary analyses. Prespecified secondary analyses showed no significant differences between CoQ10 at 2,700 mg/day and placebo. There were no safety concerns. Interpretation: CoQ10 at 2,700 mg daily for 9 months shows insufficient promise to warrant Phase III testing. Given this outcome, the adaptive Phase II design incorporating a dose selection and a futility test avoided the need for a much larger conventional Phase III trial.

Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease resulting in death, usually from respiratory failure, within 2-3 years of symptom onset. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is a treatment that when given to patients in respiratory failure leads to improved survival and quality of life. Diaphragm pacing (DP), using the NeuRx/4(®) diaphragm pacing system (DPS)™ (Synapse Biomedical, Oberlin, OH, USA), is a new technique that may offer additional or alternative benefits to patients with ALS who are in respiratory failure. Objective: The Diaphragm Pacing in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (DiPALS) trial evaluated the effect of DP on survival over the study duration in patients with ALS with respiratory failure. Design: The DiPALS trial was a multicentre, parallel-group, open-label, randomised controlled trial incorporating health economic analyses and a qualitative longitudinal substudy. Participants: Eligible participants had a diagnosis of ALS (ALS laboratory-supported probable, clinically probable or clinically definite according to the World Federation of Neurology revised El Escorial criteria), had been stabilised on riluzole for 30 days, were aged ≥ 18 years and were in respiratory failure. We planned to recruit 108 patients from seven UK-based specialist ALS or respiratory centres. Allocation was performed using 1 : 1 non-deterministic minimisation. Interventions: Participants were randomised to either standard care (NIV alone) or standard care (NIV) plus DP using the NeuRX/4 DPS. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was overall survival, defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause. Secondary outcomes were patient quality of life [assessed by European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions, three levels (EQ-5D-3L), Short Form questionnaire-36 items and Sleep Apnoea Quality of Life Index questionnaire]; carer quality of life (EQ-5D-3L and Caregiver Burden Inventory); cost-utility analysis and health-care resource use; tolerability and adverse events. Acceptability and attitudes to DP were assessed in a qualitative substudy. Results: In total, 74 participants were randomised into the trial and analysed, 37 participants to NIV plus pacing and 37 to standard care, before the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee advised initial suspension of recruitment (December 2013) and subsequent discontinuation of pacing (on safety grounds) in all patients (June 2014). Follow-up assessments continued until the planned end of the study in December 2014. The median survival (interquartile range) was 22.5 months (lower quartile 11.8 months; upper quartile not reached) in the NIV arm and 11.0 months (6.7 to 17.0 months) in the NIV plus pacing arm, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.27 (95% confidence interval 1.22 to 4.25; p = 0.01). Conclusions: Diaphragmatic pacing should not be used as a routine treatment for patients with ALS in respiratory failure. Future work: It may be that certain population subgroups benefit from DP. We are unable to explain the mechanism behind the excess mortality in the pacing arm, something the small trial size cannot help address. Future research should investigate the mechanism by which harm or benefit occurs further. Trial registration: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN53817913.

This phase I, open-label, single-dose study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of renally excreted drug dexpramipexole in subjects with normal and impaired renal function, i.e. mild, moderate, severe renal impairment, or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis when matched by age and sex. Dexpramipexole area under the curves (AUCs), but not Cmax , were significantly increased with the severity of renal impairment after a single dose administration. The geometric mean ratio of dose-normalized AUC(0-72) was 1.4, 1.7, 2.7, and 4.5, respectively, in mild, moderate, severe renal impairment, and ESRD subjects when compared to healthy subjects. There was a strong association between renal function (eGFR) and dexpramipexole CLr. The slope (90% confidence interval(CI)) of eGFR and renal clearance (CLr) in the regression model was 3.1 (2.4, 3.7). Dexpramipexole elimination in ESRD subjects during both dialysis and non-dialysis (i.e., interval between dialysis) was insignificant. Single 75 mg and 150 mg doses of dexpramipexole were well tolerated, and the safety profile was comparable across renal function groups. Extensive drug accumulation may occur with repeated dosing in patients with significant renal impairment. It is recommended that dexpramipexole not to be given to patients with severe renal impairment or in those with ESRD.

Background: Sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol have been found to reduce neuronal death in experimental models. The efficacy and safety of a combination of the two compounds in persons with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are not known. Methods: In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial, we enrolled participants with definite ALS who had had an onset of symptoms within the previous 18 months. Participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive sodium phenylbutyrate-taurursodiol (3 g of sodium phenylbutyrate and 1 g of taurursodiol, administered once a day for 3 weeks and then twice a day) or placebo. The primary outcome was the rate of decline in the total score on the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R; range, 0 to 48, with higher scores indicating better function) through 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes were the rates of decline in isometric muscle strength, plasma phosphorylated axonal neurofilament H subunit levels, and the slow vital capacity; the time to death, tracheostomy, or permanent ventilation; and the time to death, tracheostomy, permanent ventilation, or hospitalization. Results: A total of 177 persons with ALS were screened for eligibility, and 137 were randomly assigned to receive sodium phenylbutyrate-taurursodiol (89 participants) or placebo (48 participants). In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, the mean rate of change in the ALSFRS-R score was -1.24 points per month with the active drug and -1.66 points per month with placebo (difference, 0.42 points per month; 95% confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.81; P = 0.03). Secondary outcomes did not differ significantly between the two groups. Adverse events with the active drug were mainly gastrointestinal. Conclusions: Sodium phenylbutyrate-taurursodiol resulted in slower functional decline than placebo as measured by the ALSFRS-R score over a period of 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes were not significantly different between the two groups. Longer and larger trials are necessary to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sodium phenylbutyrate-taurursodiol in persons with ALS.

An orally administered, fixed-dose coformulation of sodium phenylbutyrate-taurursodiol (PB-TURSO) significantly slowed functional decline in a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial in ALS (CENTAUR). Herein we report results of a long-term survival analysis of participants in CENTAUR. In CENTAUR, adults with ALS were randomized 2:1 to PB-TURSO or placebo. Participants completing the 6-month (24-week) randomized phase were eligible to receive PB-TURSO in the open-label extension. An all-cause mortality analysis (35-month maximum follow-up post-randomization) incorporated all randomized participants. Participants and site investigators were blinded to treatment assignments through the duration of follow-up of this analysis. Vital status was obtained for 135 of 137 participants originally randomized in CENTAUR. Median overall survival was 25.0 months among participants originally randomized to PB-TURSO and 18.5 months among those originally randomized to placebo (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.92; P = .023). Initiation of PB-TURSO treatment at baseline resulted in a 6.5-month longer median survival as compared with placebo. Combined with results from CENTAUR, these results suggest that PB-TURSO has both functional and survival benefits in ALS.

Importance: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of the motor nervous system. Clinical studies have demonstrated cortical and spinal motor neuron hyperexcitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation and threshold tracking nerve conduction studies, respectively, although metrics of excitability have not been used as pharmacodynamic biomarkers in multi-site clinical trials. Objective: To ascertain whether ezogabine decreases cortical and spinal motor neuron excitability in ALS. Design, setting, and participants: This double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 randomized clinical trial sought consent from eligible participants from November 3, 2015, to November 9, 2017, and was conducted at 12 US sites within the Northeast ALS Consortium. Participants were randomized in equal numbers to a higher or lower dose of ezogabine or to an identical matched placebo, and they completed in-person visits at screening, baseline, week 6, and week 8 for clinical assessment and neurophysiological measurements. Interventions: Participants were randomized to receive 600 mg/d or 900 mg/d of ezogabine or a matched placebo for 10 weeks. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was change in short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI; SICI-1 was used in analysis to reflect stronger inhibition from an increase in amplitude) from pretreatment mean at screening and baseline to the full-dose treatment mean at weeks 6 and 8. The secondary outcomes included levels of cortical motor neuron excitability (including resting motor threshold) measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation and spinal motor neuron excitability (including strength-duration time constant) measured by threshold tracking nerve conduction studies. Results: A total of 65 participants were randomized to placebo (23), 600 mg/d of ezogabine (23), and 900 mg/d of ezogabine (19 participants); 45 were men (69.2%) and the mean (SD) age was 58.3 (8.8) years. The SICI-1 increased by 53% (mean ratio, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.12-2.09; P = .009) in the 900-mg/d ezogabine group vs placebo group. The SICI-1 did not change in the 600-mg/d ezogabine group vs placebo group (mean ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.87-1.52; P = .31). The resting motor threshold increased in the 600-mg/d ezogabine group vs placebo group (mean ratio, 4.61; 95% CI, 0.21-9.01; P = .04) but not in the 900-mg/d ezogabine group vs placebo group (mean ratio, 1.95; 95% CI, -2.64 to 6.54; P = .40). Ezogabine caused a dose-dependent decrease in excitability by several other metrics, including strength-duration time constant in the 900-mg/d ezogabine group vs placebo group (mean ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.87; P < .001). Conclusions and relevance: Ezogabine decreased cortical and spinal motor neuron excitability in participants with ALS, suggesting that such neurophysiological metrics may be used as pharmacodynamic biomarkers in multisite clinical trials.

Introduction: Increasing evidence suggests that oxidative stress may be involved in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The antioxidant vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) has been shown to slow down the onset and progression of paralysis in transgenic mice expressing a mutation in superoxide dismutase found in certain forms of familial ALS. The current study was designed to determine whether alpha-tocopherol (500 mg b.i.d.) may be efficacious in the treatment of ALS. Methods: Two hundred and eighty-nine patients with ALS of less than 5 years duration, treated with riluzole, were enrolled in this study, and were randomly assigned to receive either alpha-tocopherol or placebo daily for one year. The primary outcome measure was the rate of deterioration of function assessed by the modified Norris limb scale. Patients were assessed at entry, and every 3 months thereafter during the study period. Survival was also recorded. Biochemical markers of oxidative stress were measured in a subset of patients on entry and after 3 months of treatment. Results: After 12 months of treatment, alpha-tocopherol had no effect on the primary outcome measure. Survival was not influenced by treatment. Among secondary outcome measures, patients given alpha-tocopherol were less likely to progress from the milder state A to the more severe state B (P=0.046) of the ALS Health State scale. After 3 months treatment, analysis of oxidative stress markers showed an increase in glutathione peroxidase activity in plasma (P = 0.0389) and a decrease in plasma levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive species (P = 0.0055) in the group of patients given alpha-tocopherol in combination with riluzole. Conclusion: Although alpha-tocopherol did not appear to affect the survival and motor function in ALS, patients receiving riluzole plus alpha-tocopherol remained longer in the milder states of the ALS Health State scale and showed, after 3 months, changes in biochemical markers of oxidative stress. Further studies are required to confirm the greater sensitivity of the ALS Health State scale over other clinical endpoints.

Background: Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a potent survival factor for motoneurons. This study investigated the safety and tolerability of recombinant methionyl human BDNF (r-metHuBDNF) infused intrathecally by means of an implanted pump in patients with ALS. Methods: Twenty-five patients with probable or definite ALS were treated with either r-metHuBDNF (25, 60, 150, 400 or 1000 microg/day) or placebo in a 12-week, randomized, double-blinded, sequential, dose-escalation study. Test treatment was interrupted by a washout period from days 11 to 25 to allow the evaluation of laboratory safety measures. In each dose cohort four patients received r-metHuBDNF and one received placebo. On completion of the double-blind period of the study all patients continued to receive r-metHuBDNF in an open-label extension for up to 60 weeks. Lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were taken periodically from all patients for the measurement of r-metHuBDNF levels and in a minority of patients these were supplemented by cistemal samples. Results: Within days after the initiation of infusion the majority of patients receiving r-metHuBDNF reported mild sensory symptoms, including paraesthesias or a sense of warmth, which were usually confined to the lower limbs and were frequently exacerbated by neck flexion. In most instances these symptoms decreased or even disappeared over several weeks. Sleep disturbance, dry mouth, agitation and other behavioural effects were encountered at higher doses (>150 microg/day) and necessitated dose reductions. The spinal CSF levels of r-metHuBDNF were directly related to dose, with a lumbar to cervical ratio of approximately 4:1. Conclusions: The intrathecal delivery of r-metHuBDNF in doses of up to 150 microg/day was well tolerated and appears feasible. The reversible CNS effects with higher dose indicate that BDNF can be delivered cranially against CSF flow. The small number of patients and the design of the study did not permit conclusions to be drawn about the efficacy of the treatment.

Background: Neurodegenerative diseases are devastating conditions that most commonly affect individuals 65 years and older. Currently there are no effective treatments or cures for neurodegenerative diseases, and therapeutics that selectively target the underlying causes of these diseases are needed. Epichaperomes play a major role in the maintenance and progression of neuronal pathology. Inhibiting epichaperomes induces degradation of disease associated proteins and is a promising therapeutic approach to treat neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer's Disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Objectives: This Phase 1 clinical study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and bioavailability of icapamespib, a purine scaffold inhibitor of epichaperomes that is specific to epichaperomes, in healthy subjects. Design: Double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalating single ascending dose and multiple ascending doses and an unblinded two-period cross-over bioavailability study design. Setting: Single site in the United States. Participants: Healthy men or women of 18 to 60 years of age, inclusive, for Part 1 (single ascending dose), ≥ 60 years of age for Part 2 (multiple ascending dose), or 18 to 49 years of age for Part 3 (bioavailability). Treatment: In the single ascending dose group, oral single doses (10, 20, and 30 mg icapamespib or placebo) were administered to healthy non-elderly subjects. In the multiple ascending dose group, multiple doses (20 and 30 mg icapamespib once daily for 7 days or placebo) were administered to healthy elderly subjects. In the bioavailability group, the bioavailability of once daily oral icapamespib solution and tablet was assessed in healthy non elderly subjects. Measurements: Safety was evaluated based on assessments of treatment-emergent adverse events, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests (hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis), vital signs, and 12-lead electrocardiograms. Icapamespib concentration was evaluated in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, the latter in Part 2 (multiple ascending dose) only. Results: Forty-eight subjects in total were randomized and assessed for tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and bioavailability parameters as follows: 24 subjects in Part 1 (single ascending dose) with PU-AD 10 mg (n = 6), 20 mg (n = 6), 30 mg (n = 6), and placebo (n = 6); 16 subjects in Part 2 (multiple ascending dose) with icapamespib 20 mg (n = 6), 30 mg (n = 6), and placebo (n = 4); and 8 subjects in Part 3 (bioavailability) crossed-over between icapamespib 30 mg (tablet) and icapamespib 30 mg (oral solution). Single doses of icapamespib up to 30 mg and multiple doses of icapamespib up to 30 mg for 7 days were generally safe and well tolerated in healthy non-elderly and elderly subjects. Treatment-emergent adverse events were mild, with headache being the most common treatment-emergent adverse event. Mean icapamespib exposure (area under the curve) was dose-proportional over the dose range tested. The median time to maximum observed plasma concentration ranged from 1.00 to 2.00 h across single ascending dose, multiple ascending dose, and bioavailability groups; icapamespib exposure was 50% higher in elderly subjects compared with non-elderly subjects but was well tolerated. Conclusions: The study provides clinical evidence of the safety of icapamespib in healthy non elderly and elderly subjects and supports the advancement of icapamespib to Phase 2 evaluation in Alzheimer's Disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Objective: Dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK), which regulates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway involved in axon degeneration and apoptosis following neuronal injury, is a potential therapeutic target in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This first-in-human study investigated safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of oral GDC-0134, a small-molecule DLK inhibitor. Plasma neurofilament light chain (NFL) levels were explored in GDC-0134-treated ALS patients and DLK conditional knockout (cKO) mice. Methods: The study included placebo-controlled, single and multiple ascending-dose (SAD; MAD) stages, and an open-label safety expansion (OLE) with adaptive dosing for up to 48 weeks. Results: Forty-nine patients were enrolled. GDC-0134 (up to 1200 mg daily) was well tolerated in the SAD and MAD stages, with no serious adverse events (SAEs). In the OLE, three study drug-related SAEs occurred: thrombocytopenia, dysesthesia (both Grade 3), and optic ischemic neuropathy (Grade 4); Grade ≤2 sensory neurological AEs led to dose reductions/discontinuations. GDC-0134 exposure was dose-proportional (median half-life = 84 h). Patients showed GDC-0134 exposure-dependent plasma NFL elevations; DLK cKO mice also exhibited plasma NFL compared to wild-type littermates. Interpretation: This trial characterized GDC-0134 safety and PK, but no adequately tolerated dose was identified. NFL elevations in GDC-0134-treated patients and DLK cKO mice raised questions about interpretation of biomarkers affected by both disease and on-target drug effects. The safety profile of GDC-0134 was considered unacceptable and led to discontinuation of further drug development for ALS. Further work is necessary to understand relationships between neuroprotective and potentially therapeutic effects of DLK knockout/inhibition and NFL changes in patients with ALS. © 2022 Genentech, Inc.

Background: Spasticity is a major determinant of disability and decline in quality of life in patients with motor neuron disease. Cannabinoids have been approved for symptomatic treatment of spasticity in multiple sclerosis. We investigated whether cannabinoids might also reduce spasticity in patients with motor neuron disease. Methods: We did an investigator-initiated, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 clinical trial at four tertiary motor neuron disease centres in Italy. Eligible patients were aged 18-80 years; had possible, laboratory-supported probable, probable, or definite amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as defined by revised El Escorial criteria, or primary lateral sclerosis according to Pringle's criteria; had spasticity symptoms due to motor neuron disease for at least 3 months; had spasticity scores of 1 or greater in at least two muscle groups on the Modified Ashworth Scale; and were taking an antispasticity regimen that was maintained at a stable dose for 30 days before enrolment. Participants were assigned (1:1) by an independent statistician via a computer-generated randomisation sequence to a standardised oromucosal spray (nabiximols) containing a defined combination of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol (each 100 μL actuation contained 2·7 mg delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and 2·5 mg cannabidiol) or to placebo for 6 weeks. Participants self-titrated during the first 14 treatment days according to a predefined escalation scheme (maximum 12 actuations per 24 h), then maintained that dose for 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in the score on the Modified Ashworth Scale, which was assessed at baseline and after 6 weeks. Safety and tolerability were also monitored. Participants, investigators, site personnel, and the study statistician were masked to treatment allocation. All randomised participants who received at least one dose of study drug were included in the analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01776970. The trial is closed to new participants with follow-up completed. Findings: Between Jan 19, 2013, and Dec 15, 2014, 60 participants were randomly assigned, and 59 participants were included in the final analysis (29 in the nabiximols group and 30 in the placebo group). Modified Ashworth Scale scores improved by a mean of 0·11 (SD 0·48) in the nabiximols group and deteriorated by a mean of 0·16 (0·47) in the placebo group (adjusted effect estimate -0·32 [95% CI -0·57 to -0·069]; p=0·013). Nabiximols was well tolerated, and no participants withdrew from the double-blind phase of the study. No serious adverse effects occurred. Interpretation: In this proof-of-concept trial, nabiximols had a positive effect on spasticity symptoms in patients with motor neuron disease and had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. These findings should be investigated further in larger clinical trials. Funding: Italian Research Foundation for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Objective: To evaluate the use and tolerability of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV) in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) early in their disease by comparing active NIV and sham NIV in patients not yet eligible for NIV use as recommended by practice guidelines. Methods: This was a single-center, prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo (sham)-controlled pilot trial. Patients with ALS were randomized to receive either sham NIV or active NIV and underwent active surveillance approximately every 3 months until they reached a forced vital capacity (FVC) <50% or required NIV for clinical symptom management. Results: In total, 54 participants were randomized. The mean NIV use was 2.0 hours (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-3.0) per day in the sham NIV treatment group and 3.3 hours (CI 2.0-4.6) per day in the active NIV group, which did not differ by treatment group (p = 0.347). The majority of sham NIV participants (88%) and active NIV participants (73%) reported only mild or no problem with NIV use. Difference of change in FVC through the treatment period by group (0.44 per month) favored active NIV (p = 0.049). Survival and changes in maximal inspiratory or expiratory pressure did not differ between treatment groups. Conclusions: The efficacy of early NIV in ALS should be tested in randomized, placebo-controlled trials. The trial is registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00580593). Classification of evidence: This study provides Class II evidence that for patients with ALS, adherence with NIV and sham NIV are similar. © 2016 American Academy of Neurology.

Diffusion characteristics of the pyramidal tract were assessed in nine patients who had clinical evidence of pyramidal tract dysfunction, utilizing lambda chart analysis (LCA). The underlying pathologic process of tract dysfunction was varied and included Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD), Alexander disease, adrenoleukodystrophy (adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMD) type and cerebral type), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Wallerian degeneration (WD). While pyramidal tract diffusion characteristics in WD indicated a pathological process characterized by replacement of normal fibers by smaller cellular component such as degenerated small fibers and/or gliosis, pyramidal tract diffusion characteristics in patients with PMD, Alexander disease, and adreno leukodystrophy of the cerebral type indicated a pathological process characterized by replacement of normal fibers by larger cellular components such as spheroids or edematous space. Pyramidal tract diffusion characteristics of patients with ALS or adrenoleukodystrophy of AMD type were relatively intact suggesting a pathological process characterized by relatively preserved structural architecture. These findings are highly consistent with known pathophysiological indices and indicate the feasibility of the clinical utility of LCA for assessing pyramidal tract physiology.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) provides a reliable route for nutrition and hydration in ALS patients with dysphagia. We performed a retrospective analysis of the CNTF and BDNF databases to determine the clinical status of ALS patients within 30 days preceding PEG insertion. This analysis revealed an approximately 50% reduction of function across multiple measures of ALS disease status. A trend to earlier intervention with PEG was apparent upon review of published studies and the CNTF and BDNF studies. By comparing the rate of decline pre- and post-PEG, nutritional supplementation via PEG stabilized the weight loss experienced by patients. Death within 30 days post-PEG was associated with a marked reduction in forced vital capacity (FVC) and identified a group of ALS patients in whom PEG should be cautiously performed. These data emphasize the importance of sequential measurement of FVC in managing ALS patients to guide the timing of nutritional intervention with PEG.

Background: The intrathecally administered antisense oligonucleotide tofersen reduces synthesis of the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) protein and is being studied in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) associated with mutations in SOD1 (SOD1 ALS). Methods: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned adults with SOD1 ALS in a 2:1 ratio to receive eight doses of tofersen (100 mg) or placebo over a period of 24 weeks. The primary end point was the change from baseline to week 28 in the total score on the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R; range, 0 to 48, with higher scores indicating better function) among participants predicted to have faster-progressing disease. Secondary end points included changes in the total concentration of SOD1 protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in the concentration of neurofilament light chains in plasma, in slow vital capacity, and in handheld dynamometry in 16 muscles. A combined analysis of the randomized component of the trial and its open-label extension at 52 weeks compared the results in participants who started tofersen at trial entry (early-start cohort) with those in participants who switched from placebo to the drug at week 28 (delayed-start cohort). Results: A total of 72 participants received tofersen (39 predicted to have faster progression), and 36 received placebo (21 predicted to have faster progression). Tofersen led to greater reductions in concentrations of SOD1 in CSF and of neurofilament light chains in plasma than placebo. In the faster-progression subgroup (primary analysis), the change to week 28 in the ALSFRS-R score was -6.98 with tofersen and -8.14 with placebo (difference, 1.2 points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -3.2 to 5.5; P = 0.97). Results for secondary clinical end points did not differ significantly between the two groups. A total of 95 participants (88%) entered the open-label extension. At 52 weeks, the change in the ALSFRS-R score was -6.0 in the early-start cohort and -9.5 in the delayed-start cohort (difference, 3.5 points; 95% CI, 0.4 to 6.7); non-multiplicity-adjusted differences favoring early-start tofersen were seen for other end points. Lumbar puncture-related adverse events were common. Neurologic serious adverse events occurred in 7% of tofersen recipients. Conclusions: In persons with SOD1 ALS, tofersen reduced concentrations of SOD1 in CSF and of neurofilament light chains in plasma over 28 weeks but did not improve clinical end points and was associated with adverse events. The potential effects of earlier as compared with delayed initiation of tofersen are being further evaluated in the extension phase.

Importance: The effectiveness of currently approved drugs for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is restricted; there is a need to develop further treatments. Initial studies have shown ultrahigh-dose methylcobalamin to be a promising agent. Objective: To validate the efficacy and safety of ultrahigh-dose methylcobalamin for patients with ALS enrolled within 1 year of onset. Design, setting, and participants: This was a multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized phase 3 clinical trial with a 12-week observation and 16-week randomized period, conducted from October 17, 2017, to September 30, 2019. Patients were recruited from 25 neurology centers in Japan; those with ALS diagnosed within 1 year of onset by the updated Awaji criteria were initially enrolled. Of those, patients fulfilling the following criteria after 12-week observation were eligible for randomization: 1- or 2-point decrease in the Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) total score, a percent forced vital capacity greater than 60%, no history of noninvasive respiratory support and tracheostomy, and being ambulatory. The target participant number was 64 in both the methylcobalamin and placebo groups. Patients were randomly assigned through an electronic web-response system to methylcobalamin or placebo. Interventions: Intramuscular injection of methylcobalamin (50-mg dose) or placebo twice weekly for 16 weeks. Main outcomes and measures: The primary end point was change in ALSFRS-R total score from baseline to week 16 in the full analysis set. Results: A total of 130 patients (mean [SD] age, 61.0 [11.7] years; 74 men [56.9%]) were randomly assigned to methylcobalamin or placebo (65 each). A total of 129 patients were eligible for the full analysis set, and 126 completed the double-blind stage. Of these, 124 patients proceeded to the open-label extended period. The least square means difference in ALSFRS-R total score at week 16 of the randomized period was 1.97 points greater with methylcobalamin than placebo (-2.66 vs -4.63; 95% CI, 0.44-3.50; P = .01). The incidence of adverse events was similar between the 2 groups. Conclusions and relevance: Results of this randomized clinical trial showed that ultrahigh-dose methylcobalamin was efficacious in slowing functional decline in patients with early-stage ALS and with moderate progression rate and was safe to use during the 16-week treatment period.

Our objective was to assess the effects of acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) with riluzole on disability and mortality of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Definite/probable ALS patients, 40-70 years of age, duration 6-24 months, self-sufficient (i.e. able to swallow, cut food/handle utensils, and walk), and with forced vital capacity (FVC) > 80% entered a pilot double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial and were followed for 48 weeks. ALC or placebo 3 g/day was added to riluzole 100 mg/day. Primary endpoint: number of patients no longer self-sufficient. Secondary endpoints: changes in ALSFRS-R, MRC, FVC and McGill Quality of Life (QoL) scores. Analysis was made in the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) population, completers and completers/compliers (i.e. taking > 75% of study drug). Forty-two patients received ALC and 40 placebo. In the ITT population, 34 (80.9%) patients receiving ALC and 39 (97.5%) receiving placebo became non-self-sufficient (p = 0.0296). In the PP analysis, percentages were 84.4 and 100.0% (p = 0.0538), respectively. Mean ALSFRS-R scores at 48 weeks were 33.6 (SD 10.4) and 27.6 (9.9) (p = 0.0388), respectively, and mean FVC scores 90.3 (32.6) and 58.6 (31.2) (p = 0.0158), respectively. Median survival was 45 months (ALC) and 22 months (placebo) (p = 0.0176). MRC, QoL and adverse events were similar. In conclusion, ALC may be effective, well-tolerated and safe in ALS. A pivotal phase III trial is needed.

Objective: To evaluate dextromethorphan combined with ultra low-dose quinidine (DMq) for treating pseudobulbar affect (PBA) in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: In a 12-week randomized, double-blind trial, ALS and MS patients with clinically significant PBA (a baseline score ≥13 on the Center for Neurologic Studies-Lability Scale [CNS-LS]) were maintained, twice daily, on placebo, DMq at 30/10mg (DMq-30), or DMq at 20/10mg (DMq-20). Results: In 326 randomized patients (of whom 283, or 86.8%, completed the study), the PBA-episode daily rate was 46.9% (p < 0.0001) lower for DMq-30 than for placebo and 49.0% (p < 0.0001) lower for DMq-20 than for placebo by longitudinal negative binomial regression, the prespecified primary analysis. Mean CNS-LS scores decreased by 8.2 points for DMq-30 and 8.2 for DMq-20, vs 5.7 for placebo (p= 0.0002 and p= 0.0113, respectively). Other endpoints showing statistically significant DMq benefit included, for both dosage levels, the likelihood of PBA remission during the final 14 days and, for the higher dosage, improvement on measures of social functioning and mental health. Both dosages were safe and well tolerated. Interpretation: DMq markedly reduced PBA frequency and severity, decreasing the condition's detrimental impact on a patient's life, with satisfactory safety and high tolerability. The findings expand the clinical evidence that DMq may be an important treatment for patients suffering from the socially debilitating symptoms of PBA.

Importance: Intravenous edaravone is approved as a disease-modifying drug for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but evidence for efficacy is limited to short-term beneficial effects shown in the MCI186-ALS19 study in a subpopulation in which efficacy was expected. Objective: To evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of intravenous edaravone therapy for patients with ALS in a real-world clinical setting. Design, setting, and participants: Multicenter, propensity score-matched cohort study conducted between June 2017 and March 2020 at 12 academic ALS referral centers associated with the German Motor Neuron Disease Network. Of 1440 patients screened, 738 were included in propensity score matching. Final analyses included 324 patients with ALS comprising 194 patients who started intravenous edaravone treatment (141 received ≥4 consecutive treatment cycles; 130 matched) and 130 propensity score-matched patients with ALS receiving standard therapy. All patients had probable or definite ALS according to the El Escorial criteria, with disease onset between December 2012 and April 2019. Subgroups were defined by applying the MCI186-ALS19 study inclusion criteria to evaluate whether patients would have been considered eligible (EFAS) or ineligible (non-EFAS). Exposures: Intravenous edaravone plus riluzole vs riluzole only. Main outcomes and measures: Patient characteristics and systematic safety assessment for patients who received at least 1 dose of intravenous edaravone. Effectiveness assessment of edaravone was conducted among patients who received at least 4 treatment cycles compared with propensity score-matched patients with ALS who received only standard therapy. Primary outcome was disease progression measured by decrease in the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score. Secondary outcomes were survival probability, time to ventilation, and change in disease progression before vs during treatment. To account for the matched design, patients receiving edaravone and their corresponding matched controls were regarded as related samples in disease progression analyses; stratification for propensity score quintiles was used for survival probability and time to ventilation analyses. Results: A total of 194 patients started intravenous edaravone treatment; 125 (64%) were male, and the median age was 57.5 years (IQR, 50.7-63.8 years). Potential adverse effects were observed in 30 cases (16%), most notably infections at infusion sites and allergic reactions. Disease progression among 116 patients treated for a median of 13.9 months (IQR, 8.9-13.9 months) with edaravone did not differ from 116 patients treated for a median of 11.2 months (IQR, 6.4-20.0 months) with standard therapy (ALSFRS-R points/month, -0.91 [95% CI, -0.69 to -1.07] vs -0.85 [95% CI, -0.66 to -0.99]; P = .37). No significant differences were observed in the secondary end points of survival probability, time to ventilation, and change in disease progression. Similarly, outcomes between patients treated with edaravone and matched patients did not differ within the EFAS and non-EFAS subgroups. Conclusions and relevance: This cohort study using propensity score matching found that, although long-term intravenous edaravone therapy for patients with ALS was feasible and mainly well tolerated, it was not associated with any disease-modifying benefit. Intravenous edaravone may not provide a clinically relevant additional benefit compared with standard therapy alone.

We developed a disease-specific, 10-point functional rating scale for patients with inclusion body myositis (IBMFRS). The IBMFRS was utilized as a secondary outcome measure in a multicenter pilot trial of the clinical safety and tolerability of high-dose beta interferon-1a. In this trial, 28 IBM patients completed the IBMFRS at baseline and monthly for 6 months. The IBMFRS showed statistically significant correlations (P < 0.001) with maximal voluntary isometric contraction, manual muscle testing, handgrip dynamometry, and the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) functional rating scale (ALSPRS). Compared to these other outcome measures, the IBMFRS was also the most sensitive measure of change over the course of the study.

Background: The event-related desynchronization (ERD) in EEG is known to appear during motor imagery, and is thought to reflect cortical processing for motor preparation. The aim of this study is to examine the modulation of ERD with motor impairment in ALS patients. ERD during hand motor imagery was obtained from 8 ALS patients with a variety of motor impairments. ERD was also obtained from age-matched 11 healthy control subjects with the same motor task. The magnitude and frequency of ERD were compared between groups for characterization of ALS specific changes. Results: The ERD of ALS patients were significantly smaller than those of control subjects. Bulbar function and ERD were negatively correlated in ALS patients. Motor function of the upper extremities did was uncorrelated with ERD. Conclusions: ALS patients with worsened bulbar scales may show smaller ERD. Motor function of the upper extremities did was uncorrelated with ERD.

The parotid glands and part of the submandibular glands were irradiated in 18 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients with very advanced disease and severe drooling problems. In a prospective study, a single dosage of 7.0-7.5 Gy was administered bilateral to the larger part of the parotid glands and the posterior parts of the submandibular glands. Salivary secretion rate was assayed before and after radiotherapy. Sixteen out of eighteen patients reported satisfactory to good reduction in drooling lasting up to 4-6 months, 1/18 developed xerostomia and needed saliva substitutes, and 1/18 reported no effect. Caregivers reported positive effect in all patients. The procedure was well tolerated with few side effects. Low dosage external radiotherapy of the salivary glands is effective in reducing drooling satisfactorily in ALS patients, especially in well-hydrated patients.

Recent studies have demonstrated genetic differences between monozygotic (MZ) twins. To test the hypothesis that early post-twinning mutational events associate with phenotypic discordance, we investigated a cohort of 13 twin pairs (n = 26) discordant for various clinical phenotypes using whole-exome sequencing and screened for copy number variation (CNV). We identified a de novo variant in PLCB1, a gene involved in the hydrolysis of lipid phosphorus in milk from dairy cows, associated with lactase non-persistence, and a variant in the mitochondrial complex I gene MT-ND5 associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We also found somatic variants in multiple genes (TMEM225B, KBTBD3, TUBGCP4, TFIP11) in another MZ twin pair discordant for ALS. Based on the assumption that discordance between twins could be explained by a common variant with variable penetrance or expressivity, we screened the twin samples for known pathogenic variants that are shared and identified a rare deletion overlapping ARHGAP11B, in the twin pair manifesting with either schizotypal personality disorder or schizophrenia. Parent-offspring trio analysis was implemented for two twin pairs to assess potential association of variants of parental origin with susceptibility to disease. We identified a de novo variant in RASD2 shared by 8-year-old male twins with a suspected diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) manifesting as different traits. A de novo CNV duplication was also identified in these twins overlapping CD38, a gene previously implicated in ASD. In twins discordant for Tourette's syndrome, a paternally inherited stop loss variant was detected in AADAC, a known candidate gene for the disorder. The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) involves progressive motor neuron loss, leading to paralysis and death typically within 3-5 years of diagnosis. Dysfunctional astrocytes may contribute to disease and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) can be protective. Here we show that human neural progenitor cells transduced with GDNF (CNS10-NPC-GDNF) differentiated to astrocytes protected spinal motor neurons and were safe in animal models. CNS10-NPC-GDNF were transplanted unilaterally into the lumbar spinal cord of 18 ALS participants in a phase 1/2a study (NCT02943850). The primary endpoint of safety at 1 year was met, with no negative effect of the transplant on motor function in the treated leg compared with the untreated leg. Tissue analysis of 13 participants who died of disease progression showed graft survival and GDNF production. Benign neuromas near delivery sites were common incidental findings at post-mortem. This study shows that one administration of engineered neural progenitors can provide new support cells and GDNF delivery to the ALS patient spinal cord for up to 42 months post-transplantation. © 2022.

RIPK1 is a master regulator of inflammatory signaling and cell death and increased RIPK1 activity is observed in human diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). RIPK1 inhibition has been shown to protect against cell death in a range of preclinical cellular and animal models of diseases. SAR443060 (previously DNL747) is a selective, orally bioavailable, central nervous system (CNS)-penetrant, small-molecule, reversible inhibitor of RIPK1. In three early-stage clinical trials in healthy subjects and patients with AD or ALS (NCT03757325 and NCT03757351), SAR443060 distributed into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after oral administration and demonstrated robust peripheral target engagement as measured by a reduction in phosphorylation of RIPK1 at serine 166 (pRIPK1) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared to baseline. RIPK1 inhibition was generally safe and well-tolerated in healthy volunteers and patients with AD or ALS. Taken together, the distribution into the CSF after oral administration, the peripheral proof-of-mechanism, and the safety profile of RIPK1 inhibition to date, suggest that therapeutic modulation of RIPK1 in the CNS is possible, conferring potential therapeutic promise for AD and ALS, as well as other neurodegenerative conditions. However, SAR443060 development was discontinued due to long-term nonclinical toxicology findings, although these nonclinical toxicology signals were not observed in the short duration dosing in any of the three early-stage clinical trials. The dose-limiting toxicities observed for SAR443060 preclinically have not been reported for other RIPK1-inhibitors, suggesting that these toxicities are compound-specific (related to SAR443060) rather than RIPK1 pathway-specific. © 2022 The Authors.

Objective: To determine the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-neurotrophic factor (NTF) cells (NurOwn®, autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs, induced to secrete NTFs) delivered by combined intrathecal and intramuscular administration to participants with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in a phase 2 randomized controlled trial. Methods: The study enrolled 48 participants randomized 3:1 (treatment: placebo). After a 3-month pretransplant period, participants received 1 dose of MSC-NTF cells (n = 36) or placebo (n = 12) and were followed for 6 months. CSF was collected before and 2 weeks after transplantation. Results: The study met its primary safety endpoint. The rate of disease progression (Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale [ALSFRS-R] slope change) in the overall study population was similar in treated and placebo participants. In a prespecified rapid progressor subgroup (n = 21), rate of disease progression was improved at early time points (p < 0.05). To address heterogeneity, a responder analysis showed that a higher proportion of treated participants experienced ≥1.5 points/month ALSFRS-R slope improvement compared to placebo at all time points, and was significant in rapid progressors at 4 and 12 weeks (p = 0.004 and 0.046, respectively). CSF neurotrophic factors increased and CSF inflammatory biomarkers decreased in treated participants (p < 0.05) post-transplantation. CSF monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels correlated with ALSFRS-R slope improvement up to 24 weeks (p < 0.05). Conclusion: A single-dose transplantation of MSC-NTF cells is safe and demonstrated early promising signs of efficacy. This establishes a clear path forward for a multidose randomized clinical trial of intrathecal autologous MSC-NTF cell transplantation in ALS. Classification of evidence: This phase II study provides Class I evidence. Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology.

Ten consecutive patients with motor neuron disease (MND) who had bulbar symptoms received one or two intravenous doses followed by increasing oral doses of a TRH analogue (RX77368). Similar improvements in speech, swallowing and in tongue and jaw movements were seen after iv and oral administration in nine, five and eight patients respectively. The initial time course of improvement correlated with increasing plasma levels of the drug, but most clinical effects persisted when the levels decreased and became undetectable after 24 hours. The oral solution was tasteless and had no, or minimal, side effects.

Objective: To assess the efficacy of tirasemtiv, a fast skeletal muscle troponin activator, vs. placebo in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Methods: VITALITY-ALS (NCT02496767) was a multinational, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants tolerating 2 weeks of open-label tirasemtiv (125 mg twice daily) were randomized 3:2:2:2 to placebo or one of three target tirasemtiv dose levels, using an escalating dosage protocol lasting 28 days. The primary outcome measure was changed in slow vital capacity (SVC) at 24 weeks. Secondary endpoints included a change in muscle strength and time to respiratory milestones of disease progression. Results: Of 744 participants, 565 tolerated open-label tirasemtiv and received randomized treatment. By 24 weeks, 23 (12.2%) placebo-treated participants discontinued study treatment vs. 129 (34.2%) randomized to tirasemtiv. SVC declined by 14.4% (95% CI: −16.8, −11.9) in the placebo group and 13.4% (95% CI: −15.3, −11.6) in the tirasemtiv group (p = 0.56). Secondary endpoints did not show significant differences. However, participants who tolerated tirasemtiv at their randomized dose showed a numeric trend toward a dose-related slowing of decline in SVC (p = 0.11). Dizziness, fatigue, nausea, weight loss, and insomnia occurred more frequently on tirasemtiv. Serious adverse events were similar across groups. Conclusions: Tirasemtiv did not alter the decline of SVC or significantly impact secondary outcome measures. Poor tolerability of tirasemtiv may have contributed to this result. However, participants tolerating their intended dose exhibited a trend toward treatment benefit on SVC, suggesting the underlying mechanism of action may still hold promise, as is being tested with a different fast skeletal muscle troponin activator (NCT03160898).

Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings during right and left motor imagery allow one to establish a new communication channel for, e.g., patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Such an EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) can be used to develop a simple binary response for the control of a device. Three subjects participated in a series of on-line sessions to test if it is possible to use common spatial patterns to analyze EEG in real time in order to give feedback to the subjects. Furthermore, the classification accuracy that can be achieved after only three days of training was investigated. The patterns are estimated from a set of multichannel EEG data by the method of common spatial patterns and reflect the specific activation of cortical areas. By construction, common spatial patterns weight each electrode according to its importance to the discrimination task and suppress noise in individual channels by using correlations between neighboring electrodes. Experiments with three subjects resulted in an error rate of 2, 6 and 14% during on-line discrimination of left- and right-hand motor imagery after three days of training and make common spatial patterns a promising method for an EEG-based brain-computer interface.

Cervical magnetic stimulation (CMS), a nonvolitional test of diaphragm function, is an easy means for measuring the latency of the diaphragm motor response to phrenic nerve stimulation, namely, phrenic nerve conduction time (PNCT). In this application, CMS has some practical advantages over electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerve in the neck (ES). Although normal ES-PNCTs have been consistently reported between 7 and 8 ms, data are less homogeneous for CMS-PNCTs, with some reports suggesting lower values. This study systematically compares ES- and CMS-PNCTs for the same subjects. Surface recordings of diaphragmatic electromyographic activity were obtained for seven healthy volunteers during ES and CMS of varying intensities. On average, ES-PNCTs amounted to 6.41 +/- 0.84 ms and were little influenced by stimulation intensity. With CMS, PNCTs were significantly lower (average difference 1.05 ms), showing a marked increase as CMS intensity lessened. ES and CMS values became comparable for a CMS intensity 65% of the maximal possible intensity of 2.5 Tesla. These findings may be the result of phrenic nerve depolarization occurring more distally than expected with CMS, which may have clinical implications regarding the diagnosis and follow-up of phrenic nerve lesions.

Possible changes in brain metabolites in motor neurone disease/amytrophic lateral sclerosis (MND/ALS) were investigated using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). A series of normal, healthy volunteer controls and MND patients have been studied using a spin echo (SE) 135 ms sequence, acquiring spectra from the region of the motor cortex. A further limited series of studies have been made for similar groups of volunteers and MND patients using a STEAM 20 ms sequence (stimulated echo). Analysis of the SE 135 ms spectra indicates there are statistically significant differences in the ratios of N-acetyl-aspartate to creatine and N-acetyl-aspartate to choline between controls and MND patients. Furthermore, metabolites identified using the STEAM 20 ms may be of great importance in the investigations of free radical mediated mechanisms, which have been postulated as being important contributors to the disease process. Preliminary results indicate that 1H MRS may provide important data to help understand the disease processes in MND and it could form a useful method for monitoring the effects of future trial treatment regimens.

Patient care and minimizing complications post gastrostomy have to date received little attention in ALS patients. We compare the complications associated with pigtail and mushroom type percutaneous radiological gastrostomy tubes in this patient group. Patients requiring PRG received either Wills-Oglesby or the skin level Entristar. Retrospective review of the clinical notes was performed capturing demographic data, peristomal infection, tube displacement, tube failure, nutritional status, site of disease onset, and survival. Thirty-five patients (Group 1) had the Wills-Oglesby tube of which 14 (40%) tubes required replacement. The Entristar tube was inserted in 29 patients (Group 2) where 8 (28%) required replacement (NS). The incidence of infection was significantly lower with the Entristar tube, (p<0.001). The mean time to tube removal in Group 2 was 223 days (SD 147; range 71-494 days) due to 'buried bumper syndrome'. We conclude that the Entristar skin level gastrostomy tube is associated with a reduction in peristomal infection, tube failure and blockage compared with the Wills-Oglesby tube.

Objective: To report the safety and therapeutic effectiveness of application of concentrated bone marrow aspirate in three bedridden patients with weakness in both legs, and monitor potential improvement in neurological outcomes. Design: Case report. Intervention: Five infusions of 3x108 mononuclear cells were administrated with 12 week intervals. Bone marrow (240ML) were obtained from the posterior superior iliac spine and Bone marrow mononuclear cells were enriched by standard manual close method under aseptic condition. Results: During the follow-up study of one year after stem cell implantation, the conditions of all three patients were improved and were confirmed by physical assessment, muscle charting and Electromyography (EMG). One year after stem cell implantation patients who were bedridden before treatment could sit without support and walk with support up to 200 feet at a stretch. Conclusion: The local application of a cocktail of regenerative cell population found in an MNC fraction of bone marrow was safe and effective in improving quality of life and muscle strength in ALS patients. This case opens the need for further investigations on Autogenic stem cell transplant therapies for MND disease. Keywords: autologous bone marrow; motor neurons; stem cells.

Objective: To test the safety of spinal cord transplantation of human stem cells in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with escalating doses and expansion of the trial to multiple clinical centers. Methods: This open-label trial included 15 participants at 3 academic centers divided into 5 treatment groups receiving increasing doses of stem cells by increasing numbers of cells/injection and increasing numbers of injections. All participants received bilateral injections into the cervical spinal cord (C3-C5). The final group received injections into both the lumbar (L2-L4) and cervical cord through 2 separate surgical procedures. Participants were assessed for adverse events and progression of disease, as measured by the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised, forced vital capacity, and quantitative measures of strength. Statistical analysis focused on the slopes of decline of these phase 2 trial participants alone or in combination with the phase 1 participants (previously reported), comparing these groups to 3 separate historical control groups. Results: Adverse events were mostly related to transient pain associated with surgery and to side effects of immunosuppressant medications. There was one incident of acute postoperative deterioration in neurologic function and another incident of a central pain syndrome. We could not discern differences in surgical outcomes between surgeons. Comparisons of the slopes of decline with the 3 separate historical control groups showed no differences in mean rates of progression. Conclusions: Intraspinal transplantation of human spinal cord-derived neural stem cells can be safely accomplished at high doses, including successive lumbar and cervical procedures. The procedure can be expanded safely to multiple surgical centers. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class IV evidence that for patients with ALS, spinal cord transplantation of human stem cells can be safely accomplished and does not accelerate the progression of the disease. This study lacks the precision to exclude important benefit or safety issues. © 2016 American Academy of Neurology. Figure. Linear regression lines of individual (red… Figure.

Dexpramipexole, an orally bioavailable small molecule previously under clinical development in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, was observed during routine safety hematology monitoring to demonstrate pronounced, dose- and time-dependent eosinophil-lowering effects, with minor reductions on other leukocyte counts. Analysis of hematology lab values across two double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials at total daily doses ranging from 50mg to 300mg demonstrated that dexpramipexole consistently and markedly lowered peripheral blood eosinophils. This effect developed after 1month on treatment, required 3-4months to reach its maximum, remained constant throughout treatment, and partially recovered to baseline levels upon drug withdrawal. All doses tested were well tolerated. The overall adverse event rate was similar for dexpramipexole and placebo, and notably with no increase in infection-related adverse events associated with eosinophil-lowering effects. Given the reliance on and insufficiency of off-label chronic corticosteroid therapy for hypereosinophilic syndromes and other eosinophilic-associated diseases (EADs), a need exists for less toxic, more effective, targeted therapeutic alternatives. Further clinical studies are underway to assess the eosinophil-lowering effect of dexpramipexole in the peripheral blood and target tissues of EAD patients and whether such reductions, if observed, produce clinically important benefits.

Background: Diaphragm pacing (DP) can replace mechanical ventilation in tetraplegics and in trials has assisted respiration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients. This report describes results of DP in patients with cardiac pacemakers. Methods: Prospective, single-center and multicenter, nonrandomized, controlled, interventional protocols under U.S. Food and Drug Administration and/or institutional review board approval were evaluated. Patients underwent laparoscopic diaphragm motor point mapping to identify optimal electrode site for implantation. With diaphragm conditioning, patients were weaned from their ventilator. Perioperative and long-term assessments between the cardiac pacemakers and DP were analyzed for any device-to-device interactions. Results: Over 300 subjects were implanted from 2000 to 2010. Twenty tetraplegics with cardiac pacemakers and DP were analyzed from 6 sites. Subjects ranged from 19 to 61 years old with DP implantation 6 months to 24 years postinjury. There were no immediate or long-term device to device interactions. All patients achieved diaphragm-paced tidal volumes exceeding their basal requirements and, after conditioning, all patients could go >4 hours without mechanical ventilators; 71% could go 24 hours continuously. Conclusion: DP can be safely implanted in tetraplegics having cardiac pacemakers. Applications for temporary use of DP to maintain diaphragm type 1 muscle fiber and improve posterior lobe ventilation may benefit complex critical care patients. Copyright © 2010 Mosby, Inc.

Partial motor conduction block, an electrophysiological hallmark of demyelination, helps to identify acquired demyelinating neuropathies but its electrophysiological detection can be difficult. We report a technique that may be helpful in this regard. Twenty-five patients with partial motor conduction block secondary to acquired demyelinating polyneuropathy (ADP), 7 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 7 with stroke, and 11 control subjects, were studied. Amplitude of compound muscle action potentials was recorded after distal electrical (E) stimulation and for volitionally (V) induced responses in 82 muscles. Mean +/- SD V/E ratio was 12.3 +/- 6.6 for ADP patients, 58.1 +/- 17 for ALS patients, 11.4 +/- 9 for stroke patients, and 55.4 +/- 12.3 for controls. The V/E ratios for patients with partial motor conduction block and stroke were significantly reduced compared with ALS patients and healthy controls (P < 0.05). Surface electromyographic (EMG) recording for determination of the V/E ratio may be a useful technique for detection of a proximal conduction block if a central lesion or poor effort can be excluded. Further study of this novel technique is necessary.

The cerebral cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may show low signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI). Since these low intensity areas (LIA) are also often observed in aged patients with other diseases, we suspected that they might be a non-specific finding. We conducted a retrospective study of LIA in 139 patients with various diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems, and evaluated their relationship to age and other MRI findings. Brain atrophy, ventricular dilatation, white matter lesions, and LIA were visually evaluated on axial images of the spin echo sequences obtained with a 1.5 tesla (T) system. We found that LIA appeared after age 50 and became more common with advancing age. Their presence correlated with brain atrophy and white matter lesions. They were most frequent in the motor cortex, followed by the occipital and sensory cortices. Their incidence in the motor cortex was significantly higher in patients with central nervous system diseases than in those with peripheral neuropathy. We conclude that LIA are common in old patients with various neurological diseases and suggest that the deposition of iron in the cerebral cortices causes their development.

Objective: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide non-muscular communication for individuals diagnosed with late-stage motoneuron disease (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)). In the final stages of the disease, a BCI cannot rely on the visual modality. This study examined a method to achieve high accuracies using auditory stimuli only. Methods: We propose an auditory BCI based on a three-stimulus paradigm. This paradigm is similar to the standard oddball but includes an additional target (i.e. two target stimuli, one frequent stimulus). Three versions of the task were evaluated in which the target stimuli differed in loudness, pitch or direction. Results: Twenty healthy participants achieved an average information transfer rate (ITR) of up to 2.46 bits/min and accuracies of 78.5%. Most subjects (14 of 20) achieved their best performance with targets differing in pitch. Conclusions: With this study, the viability of the paradigm was shown for healthy participants and will next be evaluated with individuals diagnosed with ALS or locked-in syndrome (LIS) after stroke. Significance: The here presented BCI offers communication with binary choices (yes/no) independent of vision. As it requires only little time per selection, it may constitute a reliable means of communication for patients who lost all motor function and have a short attention span. 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Objectives: Neuropsychological investigations have shown a degree of cognitive dysfunction in a proportion of non-demented patients with ALS. Respiratory muscle weakness in ALS can lead to nocturnal hypoventilation, resulting in sleep disturbance and daytime somnolence. Sleep deprivation of this type may cause impairments in cognitive function, but this has not been formally evaluated in ALS. Methods: Cognitive functioning was evaluated in nine patients with ALS with sleep disturbance caused by nocturnal hypoventilation (NIPPV group), and in a comparison group of 10 similar patients without ventilation problems (control group). The NIPPV group then started non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) at night. After about 6 weeks, change in cognitive function was evaluated. Results: Statistically significant improvement in scores on two of the seven cognitive tests was demonstrated in the NIPPV group postventilation, and a trend towards significant improvement was found for two further tests. Scores in the control group did not improve significantly for these four tests, although an improvement was found on one other test. Conclusions: Nocturnal hypoventilation and sleep disturbance may cause cognitive dysfunction in ALS. These deficits may be partially improved by NIPPV over a 6 week period. This has important implications for investigations of both cognitive dysfunction in non-demented patients with ALS, and the effect of ventilation on quality of life.

Background and objective: Collagen abnormalities of skin have been reported among patients with ALS. However, little is known concerning glycosaminoglycans of the skin in ALS. Our objective was to clarify morphologic and biochemical findings of skin glycosaminoglycans among patients with ALS. Methods: We performed morphologic studies and biochemical analysis of glycosaminoglycans of skin from 8 patients with ALS, 6 patients with other neurologic or muscular diseases (control group A), and 7 patients without neurologic disorders (control group B). Results: The wide spaces that separate collagen bundles reacted strongly with Alcian blue stain in skin from patients with ALS and stained more markedly as ALS progressed. Staining with Alcian blue was virtually eliminated by Streptomyces hyaluronidase. The content of hyaluronic acid was significantly higher (p < 0.001) among patients with ALS than in control groups A and B. There was a significant positive correlation between content of hyaluronic acid and duration of illness among patients with ALS (r = 0.88, p < 0.01). However, there was no significant difference in content of dermatan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate-4S, or chondroitin sulfate-6S between patients with ALS and control groups A and B. There was also an appreciable positive correlation between optical density of Alcian blue and content of hyaluronic acid among patients with ALS (r = 0.92, p < 0.01). Conclusions: The data suggest that a metabolic alteration of glycosaminoglycans related to the increased amount of hyaluronic acid may take place in the skin of patients with ALS.

In the immediate period after traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) a variety of secondary injury mechanisms combine to gradually expand the initial lesion size, potentially leading to diminished neurological outcomes at long-term follow-up. Riluzole, a benzothiazole drug, which has neuroprotective properties based on sodium channel blockade and mitigation of glutamatergic toxicity, is currently an approved drug that attenuates the extent of neuronal degeneration in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Moreover, several preclinical SCI studies have associated riluzole administration with improved functional outcomes and increased neural tissue preservation. Based on these findings, riluzole has attracted considerable interest as a potential neuroprotective drug for the treatment of SCI. Currently, a Phase I trial evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of riluzole in human SCI patients is being conducted by the North American Clinical Trials Network (NACTN) for Treatment of Spinal Cord Injury. The current review summarizes the existing preclinical and clinical literature on riluzole, provides a detailed description of the Phase I trial, and suggests potential opportunities for future investigation.

Twenty ALS patients with sialorrhea refractory to medical therapy were enrolled in this double-blind, randomized study to receive either 2,500 U of botulinum toxin type B (BTxb) or placebo into the bilateral parotid and submandibular glands using electromyographic guidance. Patients who received BTxb reported a global impression of improvement of 82% at 2 weeks compared to 38% of those who received placebo (P < 0.05). This significant effect was sustained at 4 weeks. At 12 weeks, 50% of patients who received BTxb continued to report improvement compared to 14% of those who received placebo. There were no significant adverse events, including dysphagia, in the BTxb group, and there was no significant increase in the rate of decline of vital capacity.

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), the most frequent form of CMT, is caused by a 1.5 Mb duplication on the short arm of chromosome 17. Patients with CMT1A typically have slowed nerve conduction velocities (NCVs), reduced compound motor and sensory nerve action potentials (CMAPs and SNAPs), distal weakness, sensory loss and decreased reflexes. In order to understand further the molecular pathogenesis of CMT1A, as well as to determine which features correlate with neurological dysfunction and might thus be amenable to treatment, we evaluated the clinical and electrophysiological phenotype in 42 patients with CMT1A. In these patients, muscle weakness, CMAP amplitudes and motor unit number estimates correlated with clinical disability, while motor NCV did not. In addition, loss of joint position sense and reduction in SNAP amplitudes also correlated with clinical disability, while sensory NCV did not. Taken together, these data strongly support the hypothesis that neurological dysfunction and clinical disability in CMT1A are caused by loss or damage to large calibre motor and sensory axons. Therapeutic approaches to ameliorate disability in CMT1A, as in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases, should thus be directed towards preventing axonal degeneration and/or promoting axonal regeneration.

HTLV tax-rex DNA and antibodies in idiopathic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. J. Neurol. Sci. 129 (Suppl.) 140-144) that human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) tax-rex sequences are detectable in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 40% of patients with motor neurone disease (MND). In an attempt to confirm this we employed a highly sensitive 'nested' polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, capable of detecting single molecules of HTLV proviral DNA, to look for tax-rex sequences in the PBMCs of 43 patients with MND. We were unable to detect the presence of HTLV tax-rex in any of 43 MND patients tested, using three different PCR primer sets under both high and low stringency conditions. Using the same DNA samples we were able to detect the presence of the single-copy pyruvate dehydrogenase gene, thus demonstrating that the extracted DNA was indeed amplifiable by PCR. To further exclude the possibility that the extracted DNA samples contained unrecognised inhibitory factors we conducted spiking experiments with trace amounts (approximately 10 copies) of HTLV proviral DNA. Spiked samples yielded PCR products of the expected size. We are therefore unable to confirm the presence of HTLV tax-rex sequences in this disease.

Objectives: To evaluate the processes involved in using a novel digitally enabled healthcare system (telehealth in motor neuron disease (TiM)) in people living with motor neuron disease (MND) and their informal carers. We examined TiM implementation, potential mechanisms of impact and contextual factors that might influence TiM implementation or impact. Design: An 18-month, single-centre process evaluation within a randomised, pilot and feasibility study. Intervention: TiM plus usual care versus usual care alone. Setting: A specialist UK MND care centre. Participants: 40 patients with MND and 37 primary informal carers. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Patient, carer and staff outcomes and experiences using semistructured interviews. Descriptive data on implementation and use of TiM. Results: The TiM was acceptable and accessible to patients, carers and staff. Intervention uptake and adherence were good: 14 (70%) patients completed a TiM session at least fortnightly. Barriers to TiM use (such as technology experience and disability) were overcome with well-designed technology and face-to-face training. Reported potential benefits of TiM included improved communication and care coordination, reassurance, identification of complications and the potential for TiM to be an alternative or addition to clinic. Benefits depended on patients' current level of needs or disability. The main challenges were the large number of alerts that were generated by TiM, how the clinicians responded to these alerts and the mismatch between patient/carer expectations and nurses actions. This could be improved by better communication systems and adjusting the alerts algorithm. Conclusion: TiM has the potential to facilitate access to specialist care, but further iterative developments to the intervention and process evaluations of the TiM in different services are required.

Objective: To assess masitinib in the treatment of ALS. Methods: Double-blind study, randomly assigning 394 patients (1:1:1) to receive riluzole (100 mg/d) plus placebo or masitinib at 4.5 or 3.0 mg/kg/d. Following a blinded transition from phase 2 to phase 2/3, a prospectively defined two-tiered design was implemented based on ALSFRS-R progression rate from disease-onset to baseline (ΔFS). This approach selects a more homogeneous primary efficacy population (""Normal Progressors"", ΔFS < 1.1 points/month) while concurrently permitting secondary assessment of the broader population. Primary endpoint was decline in ALSFRS-R at week-48 (ΔALSFRS-R), with the high-dose ""Normal Progressor"" cohort being the prospectively declared primary efficacy population. Missing data were imputed via last observation carried forward (LOCF) methodology with sensitivity analyses performed to test robustness. Results: For the primary efficacy population, masitinib (n = 99) showed significant benefit over placebo (n = 102) with a ΔALSFRS-R between-group difference (ΔLSM) of 3.4 (95% CI 0.65-6.13; p = 0.016), corresponding to a 27% slowing in rate of functional decline (LOCF methodology). Sensitivity analyses were all convergent, including the conservative multiple imputation technique of FCS-REGPMM with a ΔLSM of 3.4 (95% CI 0.53-6.33; p = 0.020). Secondary endpoints (ALSAQ-40, FVC, and time-to-event analysis) were also significant. Conversely, no significant treatment-effect according to ΔALSFRS-R was seen for the broader ""Normal and Fast Progressor"" masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/d cohort, or either of the low-dose (masitinib 3.0 mg/kg/d) cohorts. Rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) (regardless of causality or post-onset ΔFS) were 88% with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/d, 85% with 3.0 mg/kg/d, and 79% with placebo. Likewise, rates of serious AE were 31, 23, and 18%, respectively. No distinct event contributed to the higher rate observed for masitinib and no deaths were related to masitinib. Conclusions: Results show that masitinib at 4.5 mg/kg/d can benefit patients with ALS. A confirmatory phase 3 study will be initiated to substantiate these data.

We performed proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI) in patients with motor neuron disease (MND) to evaluate the distribution and extent of cortical neuron damage or loss as reflected by decreased N-acetyl (NA) to creatine (Cr) resonance intensity ratios. We examined premotor (superior frontal gyrus), primary motor (precentral gyrus), primary sensory (postcentral gyrus), and parietal (superior parietal gyrus/precuneus) neocortical regions of 12 patients with MND and six normal control subjects. Patients with MND were representative of three syndromes: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with definite lower motor neuron and upper motor neuron signs, MND with probable upper motor neuron signs (PUMNS), and progressive spinal muscular atrophy (PSMA) with lower motor neuron signs only. Compared with healthy controls, ALS patients had a significant decrease in NA/Cr resonance intensity ratios, most prominently in the primary motor cortex (p < 0.001) but also, to varying degrees, in primary sensory (p < 0.01), posterior premotor, and parietal (p < 0.05) regions. Patients classified as ALS-PUMNS showed less prominent reduction in NA/Cr ratios in the same regions; patients with PSMA had normal cortical NA/Cr ratios. Sequential studies in one patient suggested that 1H-MRSI could document progression of the NA/Cr abnormality. Decreased NA/Cr ratios on 1H-MRSI provide an index of cortical motor neuron loss and/or dysfunction in MND patients. Clinical applications of 1H-MRSI could include documenting the extent of upper motor neuron involvement, aiding diagnosis of syndromes presenting with an ALS-like picture, and monitoring disease progression.

Self-assessment of symptom progression in chronic diseases is of increasing importance in clinical research, patient management and specialized outpatient care. Against this background, we developed a secure internet platform (ALShome.de) that allows online assessment of the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) and other established self-assessment questionnaires. We developed a secure and closed internet portal to assess patient reported outcomes. In a prospective, controlled and stratified study, patients conducted a web-based self-assessment of ALSFRS-R compared to on-site assessment. On-site and online assessments were compared at baseline (n = 127) and after 3.5 months (n = 81, 64%). Results showed that correlation between on-site evaluation and online testing of ALSFRS-R was highly significant (r = 0.96; p < 0.001). The agreement of both capturing methods (online vs. on-site) was excellent (mean interval, 8.8 days). The adherence to online rating was high; 75% of patients tested on-site completed a follow-up online visit (mean 3.5 months, SD 1.7). We conclude that online self-assessment of ALS severity complements the well-established face-to-face application of the ALSFRS-R during on-site visits. The results of our study support the use of online administration of ALSFRS-R within clinical trials and for managing the care of ALS patients.

Background: Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is frequently administered in mitochondrial diseases. Mitochondrial dysfunction and CoQ10 treatment was also proposed in neurodegenerative disorders as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinsons disease. Patients and methods: Seventeen patients with mitochondrial CPEO were treated with CoQ10 (dosage: 0.60 1.80 mg/kg body wt) in an open trial. Serum levels of CoQ10 were monitored before and after 6-9 and 12-15 months of CoQ10 therapy. CoQ10 concentration in muscle was measured in all patients before treatment. Results: Prior to treatment CoQ10 concentration in muscle was normal in all patients. Eight patients completed the study after 12-15 months. Prior to treatment there was no correlation between CoQ10 in muscle and serum. There was no inverse correlation of serum lactate with CoQ10 in muscle before and in serum before and during therapy. CoQ10 serum level and body weight related CoQ10 dosage correlated significantly after 6-9 months but not after 12-15 months (p = 0.043 and n. s., respectively). During continued administration of CoQ10 the CoQ10 serum level was increased 2.76 +/- 1.00-fold after 6-9 months (range: 1.04-3.80). but returned to 1.70 +/- 0.98-fold after 12-15 months (range: 0.91-3.83). Serum lactate did not significantly change during treatment. There was no effect of CoQ10 treatment on signs and symptoms. Conclusion: The only transient increase of CoQ10 in serum has to be considered in any low dose long-term treatment with CoQ10.

There is still no consensus as to which physiologic marker should be used as a trigger for the initiation of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Current practice parameters recommend that the decision to begin treatment be based upon forced vital capacity (FVC) measurements. A prospective, randomized study was performed in 20 ALS patients who had an FVC of 70-100%. Patients received baseline assessments including: ALS functional rating scale-respiratory version (ALSFRS-R), pulmonary symptom scale, Short form 36 (SF-36), FVC%, maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximal expiratory pressure (MEP), and nocturnal oximetry. Patients were randomized to receive NPPV based upon nocturnal oximetry studies suggesting oxygen desaturation <90% for one cumulative minute (""early intervention"") or a FVC <50% (""standard of care""). At enrollment, there was no significant correlation between FVC% and the ALSFRS-R, symptom score, MEP, MIP, or duration of nocturnal desaturation <90%. An increase in the vitality subscale of the SF-36 was demonstrated in 5/6 patients randomized to ""early intervention"" with NPPV. Our data indicate that FVC% correlates poorly with respiratory symptoms and suggests that MIP and nocturnal oximetry may be more sensitive measures of early respiratory insufficiency. In addition, intervention with NPPV earlier than our current standard of care may result in improved quality of life.

Sleep disruption in ALS/MND is related to hypoventilation and nocturnal O(2) saturation. Maximal inspiratory pressure (PI(max)) proved sensitive in predicting nocturnal O(2) saturation. However, PI(max) is highly dependent on patient collaboration; on the other hand Mouth Occlusion Pressure (MOP) is a reliable, non-volitional parameter index of central respiratory drive. Since exercise testing (ET) is also part of the assessment of ventilatory regulation the authors aimed to determine whether MOP and ET are sensitive and reliable parameters predictive of nocturnal O(2) saturation and clinical evolution. We conducted a Polysomnographic (PSG) study in two groups of 14 patients, selected according to their MOP level. Patients performed at admission an ET, Respiratory Function tests (RFT) and clinical evaluation with Norris spinal and bulbar scores (SNS and BNS). All patients in Group I (Low MOP) had decreased O(2) saturation during ET (P<0.001). Correlation study showed correlation between ET and MOP (R=0.6); PI(max) slope and PE(max) slope correlated with ET (R=-0.4; -0.6), respectively. ET also correlated with nocturnal O(2) saturation and SNS slope (R=0.8; -0.5), respectively. SNS and BNS slopes correlated with nocturnal O(2) saturation (R=-0.4; -0.7), respectively. The best correlations found were between MOP slope and BNS slope and SNS slope (R=0.8; 0.7), respectively. The high predictive values of MOP and ET at admission to nocturnal O(2) saturation (predicted value=80%) suggested the need of nocturnal pulse oximetry as a standard procedure. MOP and ET should also be used in evaluation protocols of ALS/MND.

Background and purpose: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease with limited treatment options. RNS60 is an immunomodulatory and neuroprotective investigational product that has shown efficacy in animal models of ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases. Its administration has been safe and well tolerated in ALS subjects in previous early phase trials. Methods: This was a phase II, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial. Participants diagnosed with definite, probable or probable laboratory-supported ALS were assigned to receive RNS60 or placebo administered for 24 weeks intravenously (375 ml) once a week and via nebulization (4 ml/day) on non-infusion days, followed by an additional 24 weeks off-treatment. The primary objective was to measure the effects of RNS60 treatment on selected biomarkers of inflammation and neurodegeneration in peripheral blood. Secondary objectives were to measure the effect of RNS60 on functional impairment (ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised), a measure of self-sufficiency, respiratory function (forced vital capacity, FVC), quality of life (ALS Assessment Questionnaire-40, ALSAQ-40) and survival. Tolerability and safety were assessed. Results: Seventy-four participants were assigned to RNS60 and 73 to placebo. Assessed biomarkers did not differ between arms. The mean rate of decline in FVC and the eating and drinking domain of ALSAQ-40 was slower in the RNS60 arm (FVC, difference 0.41 per week, standard error 0.16, p = 0.0101; ALSAQ-40, difference -0.19 per week, standard error 0.10, p = 0.0319). Adverse events were similar in the two arms. In a post hoc analysis, neurofilament light chain increased over time in bulbar onset placebo participants whilst remaining stable in those treated with RNS60. Conclusions: The positive effects of RNS60 on selected measures of respiratory and bulbar function warrant further investigation.

Objectives: Care of patients with motor neuron disease (MND) in a specialist, multidisciplinary clinic is associated with improved survival, but access is not universal. We wanted to pilot and establish the feasibility of a definitive trial of a novel telehealth system (Telehealth in Motor neuron disease, TiM) in patients with MND. Design: An 18-month, single-centre, mixed-methods, randomised, controlled pilot and feasibility study. Intervention: TiM telehealth plus usual care versus usual care. Setting: A specialist MND care centre in the UK. Participants: Patients with MND and their primary informal carers. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Recruitment, retention and data collection rates, clinical outcomes including participant quality of life and anxiety and depression. Results: Recruitment achieved the target of 40 patients and 37 carers. Participant characteristics reflected those attending the specialist clinic and included those with severe disability and those with limited experience of technology. Retention and data collection was good. Eighty per cent of patients and 82% of carer participants reported outcome measures were completed at 6 months. Using a longitudinal analysis with repeated measures of quality of life (QoL), a sample size of 131 per arm is recommended in a definitive trial. The methods and intervention were acceptable to participants who were highly motivated to participate to research. The low burden of participation and accessibility of the intervention meant barriers to participation were minimal. However, the study highlighted difficulties assessing the associated costs of the intervention, the challenge of recruitment in such a rare disease and the difficulties of producing rigorous evidence of impact in such a complex intervention. Conclusion: A definitive trial of TiM is feasible but challenging. The complexity of the intervention and heterogeneity of the patient population means that a randomised controlled trial may not be the best way to evaluate the further development and implementation of the TiM.

Intravenous (IV) edaravone is approved as an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) treatment. Because IV administration places a burden on patients, development of orally administered ALS treatments is needed. Therefore, 2 phase 1 studies of oral formulations of edaravone in healthy subjects examined the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, racial differences, and drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and investigated the dose of the oral formulation considered to be bioequivalent to the approved dose of the IV formulation. Study 1 was a placebo-controlled, randomized, single-blind study of single-ascending-dose oral edaravone with the dose range of 30 to 300 mg (n = 56). Study 2 was conducted in 2 cohorts (n = 84); the first assessed DDIs with multiple-dose edaravone 120 mg/day given over 5 or 8 days (coadministered with single-dose rosuvastatin, sildenafil, or furosemide), and the second evaluated PK and racial (Japanese/White) differences in PK parameters with doses of 100-mg edaravone. The oral formulation of edaravone was well absorbed, and plasma concentrations of unchanged edaravone increased more than dose proportionally within the dose range of 30 to 300 mg. No effect of race on oral edaravone PK and no notable DDI effects possibly caused by orally administered edaravone were observed. The oral edaravone formulations were safe and tolerable under the assessed conditions. Mathematical modeling determined that equivalent exposures in plasma with the approved dose of the IV edaravone formulation, as reported previously, could be achieved when the oral edaravone formulation was administered at a dose of ≈100 mg, with an absolute bioavailability of ≈60%.

The objective of our study was to perform a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to evaluate the effects of three strictly monitored exercise programs(SMEP) compared to ""usual care"" (UCP) in a cohort of ALS patients. We included patients with definite and probable ALS and disease duration ≤24 months. Patients were randomized to receive a SMEPs or a UCP. SMEPs included three subgroups of treatment: active exercises associated with cycloergometer activity (1A), only active (1B) and passive (1C) exercises, respectively. Moreover, SMEP patients and their caregivers were trained to a daily home-based passive exercise program. The UCP group was treated with passive and stretching exercises twice weekly. The treatment period for both groups was 6 months (T180), and patients were assessed by revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R), % Forced Vital Capacity (FVC %), and McGill Quality of Life (MGQoL) questionnaire. ALSFRS-R score was also evaluated at 6 months after the treatment period (T360). Sixty ALS patients were randomly assigned to one of two arms: SMEP Group included 30 patients, ten subjects for each subgroup (1A, 1B, and 1C); 30 patients were included in the UCP Group.At T180 and T360, SMEPs group had significantly higher ALSFRS-R score compared to the UCP group (32.8 ± 6.5 vs 28.7 ± 7.5, p = 0.0298; 27.5 ± 7.6 vs 23.3 ± 7.6, p = 0.0338, respectively). No effects of SMEPs on survival, respiratory decline and MGQol were found. In conclusion, although no effect on survival was demonstrated,our data suggest that a strictly monitored exercise program may significantly reduce motor deterioration in ALS patients.

Objective: To test the efficacy and tolerability of clenbuterol in patients with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). Methods: Twenty patients with a diagnosis of SBMA were given oral clenbuterol (0.04 mg/d) for 12 months. The primary efficacy end point was the change from baseline of the walking distance covered in 6 minutes at 12 months. Secondary end points included the change over time in muscle strength assessed with the Medical Research Council scale, the revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R), and forced vital capacity values. Safety was assessed by a series of laboratory and instrumental tests, as well as reporting of adverse events. Results: Sixteen patients completed the study. There was a significant and sustained increase in walking distance covered in 6 minutes and forced vital capacity between the baseline and the 12-month assessments (p < 0.001). No differences were recorded in Medical Research Council or ALSFRS-R scores between baseline and follow-up assessments. Serious side effects, including those on heart function, were absent. A significant increase in serum creatine kinase levels was observed. Conclusions: Our findings suggest a positive effect of clenbuterol on SBMA disease progression. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class IV evidence that clenbuterol is effective in improving motor function in SBMA.

Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) patients frequently report a family history of PD and this may provide etiological clues to PD. It has also been suggested that a report of a negative family history is reliable. We studied the prevalence of PD in relatives of PD patients to assess the reliability of family history and to evaluate possible explanations of ""familial PD"" (fPD). Methods: 81 of 650 (12.5%) PD probands (all PD patients seen at clinic in 4 years) reported a positive family history of PD. Each fPD proband was matched with non-familial PD (nfPD) proband by gender and year of birth. Screening and follow-up questionnaires were mailed to relatives to obtain information concerning pedigree and presence of neurodegenerative disease. Available family members (regardless of disease status) were examined. Results: On examination, 8 persons, said to be ""normal"" by probands, relatives and themselves, had definite or possible PD (5 fPD, 3 nfPD). The prevalence rate of PD among first and second degree living relatives of probands varied significantly between fPD and nfPD groups (6269/100,000 versus 1190/100,000; p < 0.001). The weighted prevalence (taking into account the proportions of fPD and nfPD within the clinic) was 1822/100,000, a value more than 5 times higher than reported prevalence rates of PD in the general population (p < 0.001). The prevalence rate was greater in first degree relatives than second degree. Conclusions: ""Familial parkinsonism"" cannot be explained merely by size of or advanced age within families. Significant numbers of previously unrecognized PD patients may be identified despite a ""negative"" family history. That is, the patient's report of an absence of familial parkinsonism is frequently inaccurate. The prevalence rate in relatives of PD patients appears to be higher than the general population-regardless of the family history reported by a PD patient. We believe our study suggests that genetic influences or early life environmental exposures are likely to be of etiological importance in PD.

We performed a randomized, double-blind phase I clinical trial for six months on the effects of oral L-serine in patients with ALS. The protocol called for enrollment of patients with a diagnosis of probable or definite ALS, age 18-85 years, disease duration of less than three years and forced vital capacity (FVC) ≥ 60%. Patients were randomly assigned to four different oral twice-daily dose regimens (0.5, 2.5, 7.5, or 15 g/dose). Blood, urine and CSF samples, ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) scores and forced vital capacity (FVC) were obtained throughout the trial. Disease progression was compared with matched historical placebo controls from five previous ALS therapeutic trials. Of 20 patients enrolled, one withdrew before receiving study drug and two withdrew with gastro-intestinal problems. Three patients died during the trial. L-serine was generally well tolerated by the patients and L-serine did not appear to accelerate functional decline of patients as measured by slope of their ALSFRS-R scores. Based on this small study, L-serine appears to be generally safe for patients with ALS. Keywords: ALS; BMAA; L-serine; phase I; therapeutic trial.

Objective: Previous work has shown that it is possible to build an EEG-based binary brain-computer interface system (BCI) driven purely by shifts of attention to auditory stimuli. However, previous studies used abrupt, abstract stimuli that are often perceived as harsh and unpleasant, and whose lack of inherent meaning may make the interface unintuitive and difficult for beginners. We aimed to establish whether we could transition to a system based on more natural, intuitive stimuli (spoken words 'yes' and 'no') without loss of performance, and whether the system could be used by people in the locked-in state. Approach: We performed a counterbalanced, interleaved within-subject comparison between an auditory streaming BCI that used beep stimuli, and one that used word stimuli. Fourteen healthy volunteers performed two sessions each, on separate days. We also collected preliminary data from two subjects with advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), who used the word-based system to answer a set of simple yes-no questions. Main results: The N1, N2 and P3 event-related potentials elicited by words varied more between subjects than those elicited by beeps. However, the difference between responses to attended and unattended stimuli was more consistent with words than beeps. Healthy subjects' performance with word stimuli (mean 77% ± 3.3 s.e.) was slightly but not significantly better than their performance with beep stimuli (mean 73% ± 2.8 s.e.). The two subjects with ALS used the word-based BCI to answer questions with a level of accuracy similar to that of the healthy subjects. Significance: Since performance using word stimuli was at least as good as performance using beeps, we recommend that auditory streaming BCI systems be built with word stimuli to make the system more pleasant and intuitive. Our preliminary data show that word-based streaming BCI is a promising tool for communication by people who are locked in.

Objective: To evaluate the use and reliability of database controls in place of a placebo group in pilot or ""futility"" ALS trials. Methods: We compared the rates of disease progression in the placebo arm of the clinical phase III US Insulin-like Growth Factor-I Trial (n = 90) with the rates of disease progression of 207 patients with ALS selected from 1,600 ALS database patients using the same inclusion criteria. Results: The mean rates of change in the Appel ALS (AALS) score were nearly identical in the placebo group (4.70 points/month) and in the database group (4.79 points/month). In addition, there was no significant difference in the median time to achieving a 20-point progression in AALS score: 143 days for database match vs 146 days for the placebo group (log rank p = 0.88). Furthermore, in the multivariate Cox analysis, both the rate at which the disease had progressed prior to first exam (preslope) (p < 0.001) and first exam AALS total score (p = 0.01) were shown to be covariates of subsequent rate of disease progression. Conclusion: The similarity in disease progression between placebo arm of clinical phase III trial and matched database group suggests the value of historical databases in futility trials. However, the proposed study design requires appropriate matching of study patients with database controls. Based on our results, we suggest matching by stage of the disease and rate of clinical decline in a contemporaneous ALS population.

Objective: Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a hereditary motor neuron disease caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the androgen receptor (AR). The nuclear accumulation of mutant AR is central to the pathogenesis of SBMA. Androgen deprivation with leuprorelin inhibits mutant AR accumulation, resulting in rescue of neuronal dysfunction in a mouse model of SBMA. This study aimed to investigate whether mutant AR accumulation in the scrotal skin is an appropriate biomarker of SBMA. Methods: Immunohistochemistry of both scrotal skin and the spinal cord was performed on five autopsied SBMA cases. Neurological severity and scrotal skin findings were studied in another 13 patients. Five other patients received subcutaneous injections of leuprorelin and underwent scrotal skin biopsy. Results: The degree of mutant AR accumulation in scrotal skin epithelial cells tended to be correlated with that in the spinal motor neurons in autopsy specimens, and it was well correlated with CAG repeat length and inversely correlated with the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional scale. Leuprorelin treatment inhibited mutant AR protein accumulation in the scrotal skin of SBMA patients. Interpretation: These observations suggest that scrotal skin biopsy findings are a potent pathogenic marker of SBMA and can be a surrogate end point in therapeutic trials.

Background: Smartphone studies provide an opportunity to collect frequent data at a low burden on participants. Therefore, smartphones may enable data collection from people with progressive neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis at high frequencies for a long duration. However, the progressive decline in patients' cognitive and functional abilities could also hamper the feasibility of collecting patient-reported outcomes, audio recordings, and location data in the long term. Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the completeness of survey data, audio recordings, and passively collected location data from 3 smartphone-based studies of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Methods: We analyzed data completeness in three studies: 2 observational cohort studies (study 1: N=22; duration=12 weeks and study 2: N=49; duration=52 weeks) and 1 clinical trial (study 3: N=49; duration=20 weeks). In these studies, participants were asked to complete weekly surveys; weekly audio recordings; and in the background, the app collected sensor data, including location data. For each of the three studies and each of the three data streams, we estimated time-to-discontinuation using the Kaplan-Meier method. We identified predictors of app discontinuation using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. We quantified data completeness for both early dropouts and participants who remained engaged for longer. Results: Time-to-discontinuation was shortest in the year-long observational study and longest in the clinical trial. After 3 months in the study, most participants still completed surveys and audio recordings: 77% (17/22) in study 1, 59% (29/49) in study 2, and 96% (22/23) in study 3. After 3 months, passively collected location data were collected for 95% (21/22), 86% (42/49), and 100% (23/23) of the participants. The Cox regression did not provide evidence that demographic characteristics or disease severity at baseline were associated with attrition, although it was somewhat underpowered. The mean data completeness was the highest for passively collected location data. For most participants, data completeness declined over time; mean data completeness was typically lower in the month before participants dropped out. Moreover, data completeness was lower for people who dropped out in the first study month (very few data points) compared with participants who adhered long term (data completeness fluctuating around 75%). Conclusions: These three studies successfully collected smartphone data longitudinally from a neurodegenerative population. Despite patients' progressive physical and cognitive decline, time-to-discontinuation was higher than in typical smartphone studies. Our study provides an important benchmark for participant engagement in a neurodegenerative population. To increase data completeness, collecting passive data (such as location data) and identifying participants who are likely to adhere during the initial phase of a study can be useful.

Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) regulates inflammation, cytokine release, and necroptotic cell death and is implicated in pathogenic cellular pathways in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and multiple sclerosis. Inhibition of RIPK1 activity protects against inflammation and cell death in multiple animal models. DNL104 is a selective, brain-penetrant inhibitor of RIPK1 phosphorylation in clinical development for AD and ALS. DNL104 was tested in 68 healthy volunteers to investigate safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, and pharmacodynamic effects of RIPK1 inhibition in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a first-in-human, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized single-ascending dose (SAD) and multiple-ascending dose (MAD) study. DNL104 was well-tolerated in the SAD group and during the dosing period of the MAD group. However, postdose liver toxicity in 37.5% of subjects was observed in the MAD, and assessed to be drug related. We demonstrate that DNL104 leads to RIP1 kinase inhibition, and this is not associated with central nervous system (CNS) toxicities, supporting future development of CNS penetrant RIPK1 inhibitors. © 2019 The Authors Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics © 2019 American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

This is a phase I, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose safety and tolerability study of NP001 in patients with ALS. NP001 is a novel regulator of inflammatory macrophages and monocytes. As ALS progression is thought to be related to neuroinflammation, an additional objective of the study was to assess the effects of NP001 administration on monocyte activation markers. Thirty-two ALS patients were enrolled and received either placebo (eight) or one of four (six at each dose) ascending single i.v. doses (0.2, 0.8, 1.6 and 3.2 mg/kg NP001). Patients were monitored for safety, and blood monocyte immune activation markers CD16 and HLA-DR were assessed pre- and 24 h post-dosing. Changes from baseline were calculated. Results showed that NP001 was generally safe and well tolerated. Importantly, a single dose of NP001 caused a dose-dependent reduction in expression of monocyte CD16, a marker of monocyte activation/inflammation. Additionally, monocyte HLA-DR expression was also decreased in those patients with elevated values at baseline. In conclusion, these data indicate that NP001 has an acute effect on inflammatory monocytes in ALS patient blood. The potential for modulation of inflammation in the context of ALS disease progression will require further study with long-term follow-up. Keywords: ALS; NP001; inflammation; macrophage; monocyte.

Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of pentoxifylline, a US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug, in patients with ALS treated with riluzole. Methods: The authors conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. Four hundred patients with probable or definite ALS and vital capacity less than 100% were randomly assigned to treatment with placebo or 1.2 g pentoxifylline daily. The primary outcome was death. Secondary outcomes were rates of deterioration of ALS Functional Rating Scale-Respiratory and muscle strength. The primary intention-to-treat analysis was the survival comparison of drug vs placebo, assessed before (log-rank test) and after adjustment (Cox model) for predefined prognostic factors. Results: At the end of the study, after 547 days of follow-up, 103 patients (51.7%) in the pentoxifylline group and 120 (59.7%) in the placebo group were alive (unadjusted risk 1.28, p = 0.107; adjusted risk 1.43, p = 0.02). In contrast, analysis of secondary outcome functional variables did not show the same negative effect of the drug. The most common adverse reactions were nausea, dysphagia, and flushing, all reversible after stopping the drug. Conclusions: Pentoxifylline is not beneficial in ALS and should be avoided in patients treated with riluzole. The discrepancy between survival and measures of functional changes urges caution in equating these end points in phase III trials, and suggests that both survival and function should be used in phase III trials.

The objective of the study was to establish the safety and pharmacodynamics of escalating dosages of sodium phenylbutyrate (NaPB) in participants with ALS. Transcription dysregulation may play a role in the pathogenesis of ALS. Sodium phenylbutyrate, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, improves transcription and post-transcriptional pathways, promoting cell survival in a mouse model of motor neuron disease. Forty research participants at eight sites enrolled in an open-label study. Study medication was increased from 9 to 21 g/day. The primary outcome measure was tolerability. Secondary outcome measures included adverse events, blood histone acetylation levels, and NaPB blood levels at each dosage. Twenty-six participants completed the 20-week treatment phase. NaPB was safe and tolerable. No study deaths or clinically relevant laboratory changes occurred with NaPB treatment. Histone acetylation was decreased by approximately 50% in blood buffy-coat specimens at screening and was significantly increased after NaPB administration. Blood levels of NaPB and the primary metabolite, phenylacetate, increased with dosage.

Riluzole, a benzothiazole sodium channel blocker that received US Food and Drug Administration approval to attenuate neurodegeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in 1995, was found to be safe and potentially efficacious in a spinal cord injury (SCI) population, as evident in a phase I clinical trial. The acute and progressive nature of traumatic SCI and the complexity of secondary injury processes can alter the pharmacokinetics of therapeutics. A 1-compartment with first-order elimination population pharmacokinetic model for riluzole incorporating time-dependent clearance and volume of distribution was developed from combined data of the phase 1 and the ongoing phase 2/3 trials. This change in therapeutic exposure may lead to a biased estimate of the exposure-response relationship when evaluating therapeutic effects. With the developed model, a rational, optimal dosing scheme can be designed with time-dependent modification that preserves the required therapeutic exposure of riluzole.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are the main syndromes of the chromosome 9 ORF72 (C9ORF72) hexanucleotide repeat expansion, but studies have shown a substantial phenotypic diversity that includes psychiatric presentations. This study describes hippocampal sclerosis dementia (HSD) in carriers of the C9ORF72 mutation. We compared clinical and neuropathological features of HSD in carriers and noncarriers autopsied at Johns Hopkins. Carriers presented with amnesia, agitation, dissocial behavior, and impaired self-care, whereas noncarriers showed little agitation. The groups were not dissimilar in cognitive or motor dysfunction. Neuropathological examination of carriers showed cerebellar neuronal inclusions positive for ubiquitin, p62, and ubiquilin-2, and negative for TAR DNA-binding protein 43. Noncarriers did not have cerebellar inclusions. C9ORF72 repeat-associated non-ATG translation was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. These observations broaden the C9ORF72 phenotype and place HSD in the FTD spectrum. The amnesic phenotype of HSD, which is consistent with the focal hippocampal atrophy, should be included in clinical categorizations of FTD. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01626378.

Objective: To evaluate the possible effect of reldesemtiv, a fast skeletal muscle troponin activator, on prescription and acceptance of durable medical equipment (DME) in the FORTITUDE-ALS trial. Methods: Health economic outcome information was collected in FORTITUDE-ALS (NCT03160898); sites recorded if and when DME, specifically manual or power wheelchairs, gastrostomy tubes, noninvasive ventilators, or augmentative language devices, was prescribed by a physician and accepted by the patient (DME-PAP) during the trial. Acceptance was defined as the patient agreeing the item was needed. Cox regression analysis compared time to DME-PAP for each reldesemtiv dose with placebo. Post hoc analyses evaluated all reldesemtiv doses compared with placebo. Results: At least one DME item was prescribed and accepted by 33/114 (28.9%) of placebo patients, 19/112 (17.0%) of patients receiving reldesemtiv 150 mg bid, 24/113 (21.2%) receiving 300 mg bid, and 29/117 (24.8%) receiving 450 mg bid. The proportion of new DME-PAP was significantly lower in patients receiving reldesemtiv 150 mg bid vs placebo (17.0% vs 28.9%, p = 0.032). The hazard ratio versus placebo for accepting at least one DME item for all reldesemtiv doses combined was 0.61 (confidence interval: 0.39, 0.96, p = 0.032). 25% of placebo patients were prescribed and agreed to obtain a DME item by 84 days; this threshold was met for reldesemtiv-treated patients at 120 days. Conclusions: Results suggest ALS patients receiving reldesemtiv may have lower risk of and delayed need for DME related to impaired mobility, breathing, swallowing, or speaking; this delay is consistent with other measures indicating delay in disease progression.

Dexpramipexole (KNS-760704; [6R]-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-N6-propyl-2,6-benzothiazole-diamine) is a novel synthetic amino-benzothiazole in development for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Preclinical studies have shown that dexpramipexole is neuroprotective in vitro and in vivo, is highly orally bioavailable and water soluble, and rapidly achieves and maintains high central nervous system concentrations relative to plasma. Two phase 1 clinical studies were conducted to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single and multiple doses of dexpramipexole in 54 healthy male and female adults. The effect of food on the single-dose PK of dexpramipexole was also evaluated. Single doses (50 mg, 150 mg, or 300 mg) and multiple doses (50 mg twice daily, 100 mg twice daily, or 150 mg twice daily) of dexpramipexole over 4.5 days were safe and well tolerated. Dexpramipexole was rapidly absorbed, with time to maximum plasma concentration ranging from 1.8 to 2.6 hours and half-life ranging from 6.4 to 8.1 hours under fasted conditions, and was mostly eliminated in urine as unchanged parent drug (84%-90% of dose). Food had no effect on the single-dose PK of dexpramipexole. These findings support the ongoing development of dexpramipexole for the treatment of ALS and further evaluation of the compound's therapeutic potential in other neurodegenerative diseases.

Introduction: Motor neuron disease (MND) is a rapidly fatal neurodegenerative disease. Despite decades of research and clinical trials there remains no cure and only one globally approved drug, riluzole, which prolongs survival by 2-3 months. Recent improved mechanistic understanding of MND heralds a new translational era with many potential targets being identified that are ripe for clinical trials. Motor Neuron Disease Systematic Multi-Arm Adaptive Randomised Trial (MND-SMART) aims to evaluate the efficacy of drugs efficiently and definitively in a multi-arm, multi-stage, adaptive trial. The first two drugs selected for evaluation in MND-SMART are trazodone and memantine. Methods and analysis: Initially, up to 531 participants (177/arm) will be randomised 1:1:1 to oral liquid trazodone, memantine and placebo. The coprimary outcome measures are the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale Revised (ALSFRS-R) and survival. Comparisons will be conducted in four stages. The decision to continue randomising to arms after each stage will be made by the Trial Steering Committee who receive recommendations from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee. The primary analysis of ALSFRS-R will be conducted when 150 participants/arm, excluding long survivors, have completed 18 months of treatment; if positive the survival effect will be inferentially analysed when 113 deaths have been observed in the placebo group. The trial design ensures that other promising drugs can be added for evaluation in planned trial adaptations. Using this novel trial design reduces time, cost and number of participants required to definitively (phase III) evaluate drugs and reduces exposure of participants to potentially ineffective treatments. Ethics and dissemination: MND-SMART was approved by the West of Scotland Research Ethics Committee on 2 October 2019. (REC reference: 19/WS/0123) Results of the study will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and a summary provided to participants.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been implicated in neuronal survival, neuroprotection, regeneration, growth, differentiation, and axonal outgrowth, which are known to be involved in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). Recently, the VEGF mRNA expression in the peripheral leukocytes from Alzheimer's disease or cardiovascular disease was reported to be changed. We hypothesized that the expression of the VEGF mRNA in the peripheral leukocytes may be a good candidate for the biological marker for MDD. Thirty two patients with MDD and age- and sex-matched control subjects were included in this expression study. The VEGF mRNA levels in the peripheral leukocytes from drug-naive MDD patients were significantly higher than those from the control subjects and the magnitude of the decrease of VEGF mRNA after 8-week treatment significantly correlated with clinical improvement. Then, we genotyped two single nucleotide polymorphic markers of VEGF gene, which were reported to be associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, in patients with MDD and control subjects (n=154, each). We did not find any significant association between these markers and MDD or its clinical subtypes. Our investigation indicates that the higher expression levels of VEGF mRNA in the peripheral leukocytes are associated with the depressive state and their recovery after treatment may be associated with the clinical improvement.

Background: Riluzole is a sodium channel-blocking agent used in treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. It has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Canadian and Australian authorities, and in many other countries. A phase I trial of riluzole for acute spinal cord injury (SCI) provided safety and pharmacokinetic data and suggested neuroprotective benefits. A phase IIB/III double-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) started in January 2014 (https://clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01597518). This article describes the pathophysiological rationale, preclinical experience and design of the phase IIB/III RCT of Riluzole in Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (RISCIS). Objectives: The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the superiority of riluzole, at a dose of 100 mg BID in the first 24 h followed by 50 mg BID for the following 13 days post injury, compared with placebo in improving neurological motor outcomes in patients with C4-C8 level, International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury Examination (ISNCSCI) grade A, B or C acute (within 12 h post injury) SCI. Setting: Acute trauma centers worldwideMethods:A double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled RCT will enroll 351 participants randomized 1:1 to riluzole and placebo. The primary end point is the change between 180 days and baseline in ISNCSCI Motor Score. This study has 90% power to detect a change of nine points in ISNCSCI Motor Score at one-sided α=0.025. Results: Currently enrolling in 11 centers. Conclusion: This study will provide class I evidence regarding the safety and neuroprotective efficacy of riluzole in patients with acute cervical SCI.

Lithium modulates several intracellular pathways related to neuroplasticity and resilience against neuronal injury. These properties have been consistently reported in experimental models, and involve the up-regulation of neurotrophic response and autophagy, and down-regulation of apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Clinical and epidemiological studies in bipolar disorder show that acute treatment with lithium increases plasma concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and long-term treatment lowers the risk of dementia. Neuroimaging studies indicate that lithium use is further associated with increased cortical thickness and larger hippocampal volumes. The objective of the present study was to evaluate whether these neurobiological properties of lithium reflect in increased regional brain glucose metabolism, as shown by [(18)F]FDG-PET. Participants (n = 19) were nondemented older adults recruited at the end point of a controlled trial addressing clinical and biological effects of lithium in a sample of patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Twelve patients who had received low-dose lithium carbonate for 4 years were compared to seven matched controls. Chronic lithium treatment was not associated with any significant increase in brain glucose metabolism in the studied areas. Conversely, we found a significant reduction in glucose uptake in several clusters of the cerebellum and in both hippocampi. These findings were not associated with any clinical evidence of toxicity. The clinical implications of the present findings need to be clarified by future controlled studies, particularly in the light of the potential use of lithium as a disease-modifying treatment approach for certain neurodegenerative disorders, namely, Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of DM/Q (capsules containing dextromethorphan [DM] and quinidine [Q]) compared with placebo, taken twice daily, for the treatment of pseudobulbar affect over a 12-week period in multiple sclerosis patients. Methods: A total of 150 patients were randomized in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess pseudobulbar affect with the validated Center for Neurologic Study-Lability Scale. Each patient also recorded the number of episodes experienced between visits, estimated quality of life and quality of relationships on visual analog scales, and completed a pain rating scale. Results: Patients receiving DM/Q had greater reductions in Center for Neurologic Study-Lability Scale scores than those receiving placebo (p < 0.0001) at all clinic visits (days 15, 29, 57, and 85). All secondary end points also favored DM/Q, including the number of crying or laughing episodes (p <or= 0.0077), quality of life (p < 0.0001), quality of relationships (p = 0.0001), and pain intensity score (p = 0.0271). DM/Q was well tolerated; only dizziness occurred with greater frequency than with placebo. Interpretation: Results in multiple sclerosis patients were similar to those of a previous study in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, demonstrating that DM/Q may be beneficial in treating potentially disabling pseudobulbar affect in a variety of neurological disorders.

Study objectives: To analyze the physiologic effects and tolerance of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) for patients with chronic ventilatory failure of various etiologies. Design: Prospective clinical trial. Setting: Rehabilitation unit of a university hospital. Patients or participants: Thirteen patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 9 patients with severe COPD, and 7 patients with other neuromuscular disorders (oNMDs) with chronic airway secretion encumbrance and decreases in oxyhemoglobin saturation (Spo(2)). Interventions: Pressures of MI-E of 15 cm H(2)O, 30 cm H(2)O, and 40 cm H(2)O were cycled to each patient, with 3 s for insufflation and 4 s for exsufflation. One application was six cycles at each pressure for a total of three applications. Measurements and results: We continuously evaluated respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) and Spo(2) during every application. Peak cough flow (PCF) and dyspnea (Borg Scale) were also measured before the first and after the last application. The technique was well tolerated in all patient groups. Median Spo(2) improved significantly (p < 0.005) in all patient groups. Median PCF improved significantly (p < 0.005) in the ALS and oNMD groups from 170 to 200 L/min and from 180 to 220 L/min, respectively, and dyspnea improved significantly in the patients with oNMDs and patients with COPD from 3 to 1 and from 2 to 0.75, respectively. Breathing pattern characteristics (RIP) did not deteriorate after MI-E in any patient groups. Inspiratory flow limitation significantly decreased at the highest MI-E pressures for the ALS group. Conclusions: Our results confirm good tolerance and physiologic improvement in patients with restrictive disease and in patients with obstructive disease, suggesting that MI-E may be a potential complement to noninvasive ventilation for a wide variety of patient groups.

A prospective, multicenter phase I trial was undertaken by the North American Clinical Trials Network (NACTN) to investigate the pharmacokinetics and safety of, as well as obtain pilot data on, the effects of riluzole on neurological outcome in acute spinal cord injury (SCI). Thirty-six patients, with ASIA impairment grades A-C (28 cervical and 8 thoracic) were enrolled at 6 NACTN sites between April 2010 and June 2011. Patients received 50 mg of riluzole PO/NG twice-daily, within 12 h of SCI, for 14 days. Peak and trough plasma concentrations were quantified on days 3 and 14. Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and systemic exposure to riluzole varied significantly between patients. On the same dose basis, Cmax did not reach levels comparable to those in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Riluzole plasma levels were significantly higher on day 3 than on day 14, resulting from a lower clearance and a smaller volume of distribution on day 3. Rates of medical complications, adverse events, and progression of neurological status were evaluated by comparison with matched patients in the NACTN SCI Registry. Medical complications in riluzole-treated patients occurred with incidences similar to those in patients in the comparison group. Mild-to-moderate increase in liver enzyme and bilirubin levels were found in 14-70% of patients for different enzymes. Three patients had borderline severe elevations of enzymes. No patient had elevated bilirubin on day 14 of administration of riluzole. There were no serious adverse events related to riluzole and no deaths. The mean motor score of 24 cervical injury riluzole-treated patients gained 31.2 points from admission to 90 days, compared to 15.7 points for 26 registry patients, a 15.5-point difference (p=0.021). Patients with cervical injuries treated with riluzole had more-robust conversions of impairment grades to higher grades than the comparison group.

Background: This is a preliminary report on successful results obtained during treatment of two patients with chronic spinal cord injury. The therapeutic approach was based on the generation of controlled inflammatory activity at the injury site that induced a microenvironment for the subsequent administration of autologous, BM-driven transdifferentiated neural stem cells (NSC). Methods: BM mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) were cocultured with the patient's autoimmune T (AT) cells to be transdifferentiated into NSC. Forty-eight hours prior to NSC implant, patients received an i.v. infusion of 5 x 10(8) to 1 x 10(9) AT cells. NSC were infused via a feeding artery of the lesion site. Safety evaluations were performed everyday, from the day of the first infusion until 96 h after the second infusion. After treatment, patients started a Vojta and Bobath neurorehabilitation program. Results: At present two patients have been treated. Patient 1 was a 19-year-old man who presented paraplegia at the eight thoracic vertebra (T8) with his sensitive level corresponding to his sixth thoracic metamere (T6). He received two AT-NSC treatments and neurorehabilitation for 6 months. At present his motor level corresponds to his first sacral metamere (S1) and his sensitive level to the fourth sacral metamere (S4). Patient 2 was a 21-year-old woman who had a lesion that extended from her third to her fifth cervical vertebrae (C3-C5). Prior to her first therapeutic cycle she had severe quadriplegia and her sensitive level corresponded to her second cervical metamere (C2). After 3 months of treatment her motor and sensitive levels reached her first and second thoracic metameres (T1-T2). No adverse events were detected in either patient. Discussion: The preliminary results lead us to think that this minimally invasive approach, which has minor adverse events, is effective for the repair of chronic spinal cord lesions.

Most frequently encountered causes of intractable pain and intractable medical problems, including headache, post-herpetic neuralgia, tinnitus with hearing difficulty, brachial essential hypertension, cephalic hypertension and hypotension, arrhythmia, stroke, osteo-arthritis, Minamata disease, Alzheimer's disease and neuromuscular problems, such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and cancer are often found to be due to co-existence of 1) viral or bacterial infection, 2) localized microcirculatory disturbances, 3) localized deposits of heavy metals, such as lead or mercury, in affected areas of the body, 4) with or without additional harmful environmental electro-magnetic or electric fields from household electrical devices in close vicinity, which create microcirculatory disturbances and reduced acetylcholine. The main reason why medications known to be effective prove ineffective with intractable medical problems, the authors found, is that even effective medications often cannot reach these affected areas in sufficient therapeutic doses, even though the medications can reach the normal parts of the body and result in side effects when doses are excessive. These conditions are often difficult to treat or may be considered incurable in both Western and Oriental medicine. As solutions to these problems, the authors found some of the following methods can improve circulation and selectively enhance drug uptake: 1) Acupuncture, 2) Low pulse repetition rate electrical stimulation (1-2 pulses/second), 3) (+) Qi Gong energy, 4) Soft lasers using Ga-As diode laser or He-Ne gas laser, 5) Certain electro-magnetic fields or rapidly changing or moving electric or magnetic fields, 6) Heat or moxibustion, 7) Individually selected Calcium Channel Blockers, 8) Individually selected Oriental herb medicines known to reduce or eliminate circulatory disturbances. Each method has advantages and limitations and therefore the individually optimal method has to be selected. Applications of (+) Qi Gong energy stored paper or cloth every 4 hours, along with effective medications, were often found to be effective, as Qigongnized materials can often be used repeatedly, as long as they are not exposed to rapidly changing electric, magnetic or electro-magnetic fields. Application of (+) Qi Gong energy-stored paper or cloth, soft laser or changing electric field for 30-60 seconds on the area above the medulla oblongata, vertebral arteries or endocrine representation area at the tail of pancreas reduced or eliminated microcirculatory disturbances and enhanced drug uptake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) NCBI Literature Resources MeSH PMC Bookshelf Disclaimer The PubMed wordmark and PubMed logo are registered trademarks of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

Purpose: Edaravone is a free-radical scavenger with relatively favorable properties of brain penetration. It has been approved for the indications of acute ischemic stroke and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This study aimed to establish a pharmacokinetic (PK) model to fit the PK profile of edaravone after a single sublingual (SL) dose of a novel edaravone tablet and single IV infusion of injectable edaravone in healthy Chinese volunteers participating in a bioavailability study. The model is expected to be useful for predicting the concentration-time profiles of edaravone following different dosing regimens in a healthy Chinese population. The purposes were to identify an optimal dose and dosing regimen for the new SL formulation and to support future clinical exploration of this tablet product in its approved indications and other therapeutic fields being developed. Methods: The PK profiles after a single SL dose or IV infusion of edaravone 30 mg can be well described by a 3-compartment linear disposition model, on which a first-order absorption model with a lag time and a parameter for bioavailability was incorporated to fit the absorption phase of the SL dose. Performance of these PK models was evaluated for goodness of fit, residual trends, visual predictive checks, as well as precision of model predictions against external data. The validated models were employed for simulating the PK profiles of edaravone after a single SL dose of 60 mg and IV infusion of 60 mg for 60 min. Findings: The resultant estimates support the possibility and feasibility of demonstrating bioequivalence between an SL administration of edaravone 60 mg and the currently approved dosing regimen for ALS (ie, 60 mg IV over 60 min) once per day. The calculation of sample size suggested that the requirement for subject number was acceptable considering the general capacity of a Phase I study center, and so were the procedures defined in the protocol. Implication: The models can be further applied to simulate favorable concentration-time profiles in diseases with different underlying courses of oxidative stress, and hence facilitate the optimization of current dosing regimens.

Riluzole is a glutamate-modulating agent with neuroprotective properties approved for use in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The efficacy and safety of riluzole vs placebo as an adjunct to antidepressant medication in outpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD) was examined in a 3-site, 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose trial using a sequential parallel comparison design comprised of two phases of 4 weeks. Patients with MDD in a current major depressive episode (N=104) with an inadequate response to either a prospective or a historical trial of an antidepressant medication were randomized in a 2 : 3 : 3 ratio to the treatment sequences of riluzole/riluzole, placebo/placebo, and placebo/riluzole, respectively. The primary outcome was change in depression severity, as assessed by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Secondary efficacy outcomes included the response rate, defined as at least a 50% improvement in MADRS, Clinical Global Impressions severity and improvement subscales, and patient-reported measures of depression and cognitive function. Eighty-five patients completed the randomized treatment phases. Treatment groups did not differ in mean change in MADRS scores, response rate, or in any secondary efficacy outcomes. Riluzole was generally well tolerated, with a side effect profile consistent with its clinical use. In conclusion, a fixed dose of riluzole (100 mg/day) did not show adjunctive antidepressant efficacy compared to placebo. The trial was adequately powered to detect a moderate riluzole effect, and the risk for exaggerated placebo responses was mitigated. The lack of efficacy suggests that mechanisms underlying riluzole's neuroprotective effects are insufficient for clinical response in treatment-resistant depression.

Background: TCH346 exerts antiapoptotic effects by binding to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and blocking the apoptotic pathway in which GAPDH is involved. Apoptosis is considered to be a key pathogenic mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases including ALS. Methods: Patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to receive either placebo or one of four doses of TCH346 (1.0, 2.5, 7.5, or 15 mg/day) administered orally once daily for at least 24 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the rate of change in the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R). The trial design included a 16-week lead-in phase to determine each patient's rate of disease progression. The between treatment comparison was adjusted for the individual pretreatment rates of progression. The study was powered to detect a 25% reduction in the rate of decline of the ALSFRS-R as compared with placebo. Secondary outcome measures included survival, pulmonary function, and manual muscle testing (MMT). Results: Five hundred ninety-one patients were enrolled at 42 sites in Europe and North America. There were no differences in baseline variables. There were no significant differences between placebo and active treatment groups in the mean rate of decline of the ALSFRS-R or in the secondary outcome measures (survival, pulmonary function, and MMT). Conclusion: The trial revealed no evidence of a beneficial effect of TCH346 on disease progression in patients with ALS.

Background: Severe spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) (Werdnig-Hoffmann disease, acute SMA, and SMA I) is a disease of the motor neuron characterized by onset before 6 months of age, failure ever to achieve sitting without support, and a life expectancy of 2 years or less. There is no known treatment for SMA, and, until recently, no therapeutic trials have been attempted. There is reason to believe that glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, enhances programmed cell death of anterior horn cells. Riluzole, a glutamate inhibitor, has been shown to slow the rate of decline in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, another form of motor neuron disease. Objectives: To determine whether a glutamate inhibitor might be tolerated by infants with SMA and, furthermore, whether this medication could have a positive effect on life expectancy. Design: Subjects with homozygous deletions of the survival motor neuron gene were recruited from pediatric neuromuscular clinics and randomized in a 2:1 ratio, 2 riluzole to 1 placebo. Neurologic examination was performed at the first visit by one of the investigators. Complete blood count, hepatic and renal screens, and urinalysis were performed at baseline, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months after drug or placebo was started. An electrocardiogram was done at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. Treatment was stopped after 9 months, and blood work was repeated at 12 months. Treatment was reinstituted at 1 year if requested by the parents. The enrollment goal was 30 patients; however, support from the pharmaceutical company was withdrawn when Rhone-Poulenc Rorer was taken over by Aventis. The investigational review boards of the participating centers approved the protocol and consent forms. Results: Seven patients received riluzole and 3 received placebo medication. All 3 patients in the placebo group died (mean age, 9 months). Three of 7 who received active drug are still living at ages 513 years, 4 years, and 30 months. None of the 10 subjects experienced adverse effects or changes in laboratory test results. None showed any change in motor abilities. Conclusions: Riluzole appears to be safe in young children. This was a limited study with insufficient power to show a difference between the 2 groups. Because there is a suggestion of possible benefit in treated subjects, we recommend further study of riluzole in pediatric patients with SMA.

Objective: Objective of this study is the comprehensive characterisation of motor unit (MU) loss in type III and IV Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) using motor unit number index (MUNIX), and evaluation of compensatory mechanisms based on MU size indices (MUSIX). Methods: Nineteen type III and IV SMA patients and 16 gender- and age-matched healthy controls were recruited. Neuromuscular performance was evaluated by muscle strength testing and functional scales. Compound motor action potential (CMAP), MUNIX and MUSIX were studied in the abductor pollicis brevis (APB), abductor digiti minimi (ADM), deltoid, tibialis anterior and trapezius muscles. A composite MUNIX score was also calculated. Results: SMA patients exhibited significantly reduced MUNIX values (p < 0.05) in all muscles, while MUSIX was increased, suggesting active re-innervation. Significant correlations were identified between MUNIX/MUSIX and muscle strength. Similarly, composite MUNIX scores correlated with disability scores. Interestingly, in SMA patients MUNIX was much lower in the ADM than in the ABP, a pattern which is distinctly different from that observed in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Conclusions: MUNIX is a sensitive measure of MU loss in adult forms of SMA and correlates with disability. Significance: MUNIX evaluation is a promising candidate biomarker for longitudinal studies and pharmacological trials in adult SMA patients.

Background: Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is associated with neurological disorders or injury affecting the brain, and characterized by frequent, uncontrollable episodes of crying and/or laughing that are exaggerated or unrelated to the patient's emotional state. Clinical trials establishing dextromethorphan and quinidine (DM/Q) as PBA treatment were conducted in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or multiple sclerosis (MS). This trial evaluated DM/Q safety in patients with PBA secondary to any neurological condition affecting the brain. Objective: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of DM/Q during long-term administration to patients with PBA associated with multiple neurological conditions. Methods: Fifty-two-week open-label study of DM/Q 30/30 mg twice daily. Safety measures included adverse events (AEs), laboratory tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, and physical examinations. Clinical trial registration: #NCT00056524. Results: A total of 553 PBA patients with >30 different neurological conditions enrolled; 296 (53.5%) completed. The most frequently reported treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) were nausea (11.8%), dizziness (10.5%), headache (9.9%), somnolence (7.2%), fatigue (7.1%), diarrhea (6.5%), and dry mouth (5.1%). TRAEs were mostly mild/moderate, generally transient, and consistent with previous controlled trials. Serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in 126 patients (22.8%), including 47 deaths, mostly due to ALS progression and respiratory failure. No SAEs were deemed related to DM/Q treatment by investigators. ECG results suggested no clinically meaningful effect of DM/Q on myocardial repolarization. Differences in AEs across neurological disease groups appeared consistent with the known morbidity of the primary neurological conditions. Study interpretation is limited by the small size of some disease groups, the lack of a specific efficacy measure and the use of a DM/Q dose higher than the eventually approved dose. Conclusions: DM/Q was generally well tolerated over this 52 week trial in patients with PBA associated with a wide range of neurological conditions.

Serum levels of insulin and insulin-like growth factors and their binding proteins (IGFs and IGFBPs, respectively) are changed in human neurodegenerative diseases of very different etiology, such as Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or cerebellar ataxia. However, the significance of these endocrine disturbances is not clear. We now report that in two very different inherited neurodegenerative conditions, ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1A (CMT-1A) disease, serum levels of IGFs are also altered. Both types of patients have increased serum IGF-I and IGFBP-2 levels, and decreased serum IGFBP-1 levels, while only AT patients have high serum insulin levels. Furthermore, serum IGFs are also changed in three different animal models of neurodegeneration: neurotoxin-induced motor discoordination, diabetic neuropathy, and hereditary cerebellar ataxia. In these three models, serum insulin levels are significantly decreased, serum IGF-I and IGFBP-1, -2, and -3 are decreased in diabetic and neurotoxin-injected rats, while serum IGFBP-1 is increased in hereditary ataxic rats. Altogether, these observations indicate that a great variety of neurodegenerative diseases show endocrine perturbations, resulting in changes in serum IGFs levels. These perturbations are disease-specific and are probably due to metabolic and endocrine derangements, nerve cell death, and sickness-related disturbances associated to the neurodegenerative process. Our observations strongly support the need to evaluate serum IGFs in other neurodegenerative conditions. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.

In preclinical studies, medications which decrease glutamate release have been shown to block some of the effects of psychostimulants. One such medication is riluzole, marketed for the treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). The goal of this study was to determine riluzole's effects on acute physiological and subjective responses to d-amphetamine in healthy volunteers. Seven male and 5 female subjects participated in an outpatient double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Across 4 sessions, subjects were randomly assigned to a sequence of 4 oral treatments: placebo, 20 mg D-amphetamine alone, 100 mg riluzole alone, or d-amphetamine plus riluzole. Outcome measures included heart rate, blood pressure, plasma cortisol, performance on the Sustained Attention to Response Test (SART), and subjective measures. d-amphetamine increased heart rate, blood pressure and plasma cortisol levels while inducing psychostimulant-type subjective effects. On the SART, d-amphetamine enhanced the speed of correct responses but also significantly increased the number of errors of commission. Riluzole at 100 mg did not block, the typical subjective and physiological responses to 20 mg D-amphetamine. Riluzole alone induced amphetamine-like subjective responses. On the SART test, riluzole increased the number errors of commission, but unlike d-amphetamine, did not speed reaction time. The mechanism accounting for these findings is unclear, but may involve processes other than decreased glutamate release by riluzole. The effects of glutamate medications on psychostimulant responses need to be further examined.

Exercise intolerance is one of the major symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Exercise training can benefit COPD patients, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The modified Total Body Recumbent Stepper (TBRS, Nustep-T4) can benefit patients with stroke, spinal cord injury and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Nevertheless, the effect of TBRS training alone on pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in COPD patients remains largely unknown. We aimed to explore the effect of TBRS training on exercise capacity and the thioredoxin system (TRXS) in COPD patients to provide a novel rehabilitation modality and new theoretical basis for PR of COPD patients. Ninety stable COPD patients were randomly divided into a control group (NC group) and a TBRS training group (TBRS group), with 45 cases in each group. Subjects in the TBRS training group were scheduled to undergo TBRS endurance training triweekly for 12 weeks under the guidance of a rehabilitation therapist. We assessed the primary outcome: exercise capacity (6-min walking distance, 6MWD); and secondary outcomes: perception of dyspnoea (mMRC, Borg), the COPD assessment test (CAT), the BODE index, pulmonary function, the number of acute exacerbations of COPD and oxidative stress (TRXS) at one-year follow-up. Compared with before the intervention and the control group, after the intervention, the TBRS training group, exhibited an increase in the 6MWD (from 366.92 ± 85.81 to 484.10 ± 71.90, 484.10 ± 71.90 vs 370.63 ± 79.87, P < 0.01), while the scores on the BORG, mMRC, BODE index, CAT, and the number of acute exacerbations of COPD were reduced, and the protein and mRNA expression levels of TRXS was significantly increased (P < 0.01). However, no differences were found in PF parameters in the comparison with before the intervention or between groups. TBRS training can effectively increase exercise capacity, while there are indications that it can alleviate COPD-related dyspnoea and reduce the number of acute exacerbations of COPD. Interestingly, long-term regular TBRS training may reduce oxidative stress associated with COPD to increase exercise capacity. © 2022. The Author(s). The authors declare no competing interests.

We have chosen to test the safety of human intracerebroventricular (ICV) brain injections of autologous non-genetically-modified adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (ADSVF). In this IRB-approved trial, 24 patients received ICV ADSVF via an implanted reservoir between 5/22/14 and 5/22/17. Seven others were injected via their ventriculo-peritoneal shunts. Ten patients had Alzheimer's disease (AD), 6 had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 6 had progressive multiple sclerosis (MS-P), 6 had Parkinson's ""Plus"" (PD+), 1 had spinal cord injury, 1 had traumatic brain injury, and 1 had stroke. Median age was 74 (range 41-83). Injections were planned every 2-3 months. Thirty-one patients had 113 injections. Patients received SVF injection volumes of 3.5-20 cc (median:4 cc) containing 4.05 × 105 to 6.2 × 107 cells/cc, which contained an average of 8% hematopoietic and 7.5% adipose stem cells. Follow-up ranged from 0 to 36 months (median: 9.2 months). MRIs post injection(s) were unchanged, except for one AD patient whose hippocampal volume increased from < 5th percentile to 48th percentile (NeuroQuant® volumetric MRI). Of the 10 AD patients, 8 were stable or improved in tests of cognition. Two showed improvement in P-tau and ß-amyloid levels. Of the 6 MS-P patients all are stable or improved. Four of 6 ALS patients died of disease progression. Twelve of 111 injections (11%) led to 1-4 days of transient meningismus, and mild temperature elevation, which resolved with acetaminophen and/or dexamethasone. Two (1.8% of injections) required hospitalization for these symptoms. One patient (0.9% of injections) had his reservoir removed and later replaced for presumed infection. In this Phase 1 safety trial, ADSVF was safely injected into the human brain ventricular system in patients with no other treatment options. Secondary endpoints of clinical improvement or stability were particularly promising in the AD and MS-P groups. These results will be submitted for a Phase 2 FDA-approved trial.

Edaravone 30mg IV has been approved for use in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke in Japan and China, and for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in Japan and the United States. Considering the inconvenience of IV infusion in clinical practice, an oral tablet formulation of edaravone was developed but failed in 2011 due to poor bioavailability. More recently, a sublingual (SL) tablet formulation of edaravone 30mg was developed by a Good Manufacturing Practices-compliant manufacturer in China. This study explored the bioavailability of the SL tablet of edaravone and aimed to provide evidence to support decision making in future clinical development. Methods: This 2-way crossover study was conducted in 10 healthy male volunteers. Eligible subjects were randomized, in a 1:1 ratio, to 1 of 2 dosing sequences: (1) SL edaravone 30mg, followed by edaravone 30mg IV infusion given over 30 minutes; or (2) edaravone 30mg IV infusion given over 30 minutes, followed by SL edaravone 30mg. The washout period between the 2 dosing periods was at least 24hours. Serial blood samples were collected in each dosing period. The bioavailability of the SL tablet was assessed using bioavailability analysis. Tolerability was evaluated throughout the study. Findings: The plasma concentration-time profile of the SL tablet was similar to that with the IV infusion. Amean (SD) Cmax of 2030.2 (517.2) ng/mL was reached within a median Tmax of 0.875hour, which was statistically significantly longer than the median Tmax with IV administration (0.5 hour). The Cmax with SL administration corresponded to 83.92% (90% CI, 73.22%-96.18%) of the Cmax with the start of IV infusion (2354.0 [336.6] ng/mL). The mean AUC0-t with SL dosing was 5420.07 (1429.75) h · ng/mL, which corresponded to 91.94% (90% CI, 86.81%-97.39%) of the AUC0-t with IV administration (5824.42 [1338.48] h · ng/mL). Two cases of adverse events were reported during the study; both were considered by the investigator to have been possibly not related to the study treatment. Implications: The bioavailability of the SL tablet of edaravone was 91.94%. Compared with IV administration, Cmax with SL administration was ∼17% lower and Tmax was statistically significantly longer. The exposure differences can be addressed by modifying the strength of the SL tablet, and then conducting a second study to demonstrate the pharmacokinetic bioavailability of the sublingually administered new strength versus IV infusion of edaravone.

Background: Dextromethorphan 20 mg / quinidine 10 mg (DM/Q) was approved to treat pseudobulbar affect (PBA) based on phase 3 trials conducted in participants with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or multiple sclerosis. PRISM II evaluated DM/Q effectiveness, safety, and tolerability for PBA following stroke, dementia, or traumatic brain injury (TBI). Objective: To report results from the TBI cohort of PRISM II, including a TBI-specific functional scale. Design: Open-label trial evaluating twice-daily DM/Q over 90 days. Study participants: Adults (n = 120) with a clinical diagnosis of PBA secondary to nonpenetrating TBI; stable psychiatric medications were allowed. Methods: PRISM II was an open-label, 12-week trial enrolling adults with PBA secondary to dementia, stroke, or TBI (NCT01799941). All study participants received DM/Q 20/10 mg twice daily. Study visits occurred at baseline and at day 30 and day 90. Setting: 150 U.S. centers. Main outcome measurements: Primary endpoint was change in Center for Neurologic Study-Lability Scale (CNS-LS) score from baseline to day 90. Secondary outcomes included PBA episode count, Clinical and Patient Global Impression of Change (CGI-C; PGI-C), Quality of Life-Visual Analog Scale (QOL-VAS), treatment satisfaction, Neurobehavioral Functioning Inventory (NFI), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Results: DM/Q-treated participants showed significant mean (SD) reductions in CNS-LS from baseline (day 30, -5.6 [5.2]; day 90, -8.5 [5.2]; both, P<.001). Compared with baseline, PBA episodes were reduced by 61.3% and 78.5% at days 30 and 90 (both, P<.001). At day 90, 78% and 73% of study participants had ""much improved"" or ""very much improved"" on the CGI-C and PGI-C. QOL-VAS scores were significantly reduced from baseline (-3.7 [3.3], P<.001). Mean (SD) PHQ-9 scores improved compared to baseline at day 30 (-3.2 [5.3], P<.001) and 90 (-5.2 [6.4], P<.001). NFI T scores were significantly improved (P<.001), whereas MMSE scores were unchanged. Adverse events (AEs) were consistent with the known DM/Q safety profile; the most common AE was diarrhea (8.3%). Conclusions: DM/Q was well tolerated, and it significantly reduced PBA episodes in study participants with TBI. Changes in CNS-LS and PBA episode count were similar to changes with DM/Q in phase 3 trials. Level of evidence: II. Copyright © 2018 American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.

Combining agents with different mechanisms of action may be necessary for meaningful results in treating ALS. The combinations of minocycline-creatine and celecoxib-creatine have additive effects in the murine model. New trial designs are needed to efficiently screen the growing number of potential neuroprotective agents. Our objective was to assess two drug combinations in ALS using a novel phase II trial design. We conducted a randomized, double-blind selection trial in sequential pools of 60 patients. Participants received minocycline (100 mg)-creatine (10 g) twice daily or celecoxib (400 mg)-creatine (10 g) twice daily for six months. The primary objective was treatment selection based on which combination best slowed deterioration in the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R); the trial could be stopped after one pool if the difference between the two arms was adequately large. At trial conclusion, each arm was compared to a historical control group in a futility analysis. Safety measures were also examined. After the first patient pool, the mean six-month decline in ALSFRS-R was 5.27 (SD=5.54) in the celecoxib-creatine group and 6.47 (SD=9.14) in the minocycline-creatine group. The corresponding decline was 5.82 (SD=6.77) in the historical controls. The difference between the two sample means exceeded the stopping criterion. The null hypothesis of superiority was not rejected in the futility analysis. Skin rash occurred more frequently in the celecoxib-creatine group. In conclusion, the celecoxib-creatine combination was selected as preferable to the minocycline-creatine combination for further evaluation. This phase II design was efficient, leading to treatment selection after just 60 patients, and can be used in other phase II trials to assess different agents.

Background: Rare neuromuscular diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy, spinal bulbar muscular atrophy, muscular dystrophy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, distal myopathy, sporadic inclusion body myositis, congenital myopathy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis lead to incurable amyotrophy and consequent loss of ambulation. Thus far, no therapeutic approaches have been successful in recovering the ambulatory ability. Thus, the aim of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cybernic treatment with a wearable cyborg Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL, Lower Limb Type) in improving the ambulatory function in those patients. Results: We conducted an open-label, randomised, controlled crossover trial to test HAL at nine hospitals between March 6, 2013 and August 8, 2014. Eligible patients were older than 18 years and had a diagnosis of neuromuscular disease as specified above. They were unable to walk for 10 m independently and had neither respiratory failure nor rapid deterioration in gait. The primary endpoint was the distance passed during a two-minute walk test (2MWT). The secondary endpoints were walking speed, cadence, and step length during the 10-m walk test (10MWT), muscle strength by manual muscle testing (MMT), and a series of functional measures. Adverse events and failures/problems/errors with HAL were also evaluated. Thirty patients were randomly assigned to groups A or B, with each group of 15 receiving both treatments in a crossover design. The efficacy of a 40-min walking program performed nine times was compared between HAL plus a hoist and a hoist only. The final analysis included 13 and 11 patients in groups A and B, respectively. Cybernic treatment with HAL resulted in a 10.066% significantly improved distance in 2MWT (95% confidence interval, 0.667-19.464; p = 0.0369) compared with the hoist only treatment. Among the secondary endpoints, the total scores of MMT and cadence at 10MWT were the only ones that showed significant improvement. The only adverse effects were slight to mild myalgia, back pain, and contact skin troubles, which were easily remedied. Conclusions: HAL is a new treatment device for walking exercise, proven to be more effective than the conventional method in patients with incurable neuromuscular diseases.

Dysregulation of glutamatergic neural circuits has been implicated in a cycle of toxicity, believed among the neurobiological underpinning of Alzheimer's disease. Previously, we reported preclinical evidence that the glutamate modulator riluzole, which is FDA approved for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, has potential benefits on cognition, structural and molecular markers of ageing and Alzheimer's disease. The objective of this study was to evaluate in a pilot clinical trial, using neuroimaging biomarkers, the potential efficacy and safety of riluzole in patients with Alzheimer's disease as compared to placebo. A 6-month phase 2 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted at two sites. Participants consisted of males and females, 50 to 95 years of age, with a clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease, and Mini-Mental State Examination between 19 and 27. Ninety-four participants were screened, 50 participants who met inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to receive 50 mg riluzole (n = 26) or placebo (n = 24) twice a day. Twenty-two riluzole-treated and 20 placebo participants completed the study. Primary end points were baseline to 6 months changes in (i) cerebral glucose metabolism as measured with fluorodeoxyglucose-PET in prespecified regions of interest (hippocampus, posterior cingulate, precuneus, lateral temporal, inferior parietal, frontal); and (ii) changes in posterior cingulate levels of the neuronal viability marker N-acetylaspartate as measured with in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Secondary outcome measures were neuropsychological testing for correlation with neuroimaging biomarkers and in vivo measures of glutamate in posterior cingulate measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy as a potential marker of target engagement. Measures of cerebral glucose metabolism, a well-established Alzheimer's disease biomarker and predictor of disease progression, declined significantly less in several prespecified regions of interest with the most robust effect in posterior cingulate, and effects in precuneus, lateral temporal, right hippocampus and frontal cortex in riluzole-treated participants in comparison to the placebo group. No group effect was found in measures of N-acetylaspartate levels. A positive correlation was observed between cognitive measures and regional cerebral glucose metabolism. A group × visit interaction was observed in glutamate levels in posterior cingulate, potentially suggesting engagement of glutamatergic system by riluzole. In vivo glutamate levels positively correlated with cognitive performance. These findings support our main primary hypothesis that cerebral glucose metabolism would be better preserved in the riluzole-treated group than in the placebo group and provide a rationale for more powered, longer duration studies of riluzole as a potential intervention for Alzheimer's disease.

Background: Phase 3 trials supporting dextromethorphan/quinidine (DM/Q) use as a treatment for pseudobulbar affect (PBA) were conducted in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or multiple sclerosis (MS). The PRISM II study provides additional DM/Q experience with PBA secondary to dementia, stroke, or traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods: Participants in this open-label, multicenter, 90-day trial received DM/Q 20/10 mg twice daily. The primary outcome was the Center for Neurologic Study-Lability Scale (CNS-LS), assessing change in PBA episode frequency and severity. The CNS-LS final visit score was compared to baseline (primary analysis) and to the response in a previously conducted placebo-controlled trial with DM/Q in patients with ALS or MS. Secondary outcomes included change in PBA episode count and Clinical Global Impression of Change with respect to PBA as rated by a clinician (CGI-C) and by the patient or caregiver (PGI-C). Results: The study enrolled 367 participants with PBA secondary to dementia, stroke, or TBI. Mean (standard deviation [SD]) CNS-LS score improved significantly from 20.4 (4.4) at baseline to 12.8 (5.0) at Day 90/Final Visit (change, -7.7 [6.1]; P < .001, 95 % CI: -8.4, -7.0). This magnitude of improvement was consistent with DM/Q improvement in the earlier phase-3, placebo-controlled trial (mean [95 % CI] change from baseline, -8.2 [-9.4, -7.0]) and numerically exceeds the improvement seen with placebo in that study (-5.7 [-6.8, -4.7]). Reduction in PBA episode count was 72.3 % at Day 90/Final Visit compared with baseline (P < .001). Scores on CGI-C and PGI-C showed that 76.6 and 72.4 % of participants, respectively, were ""much"" or ""very much"" improved with respect to PBA. The most frequently occurring adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea (5.4 %), headache (4.1 %), urinary tract infection (2.7 %), and dizziness (2.5 %); 9.8 % had AEs that led to discontinuation. Serious AEs were reported in 6.3 %; however, none were considered treatment related. Conclusions: DM/Q was shown to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment for PBA secondary to dementia, stroke, or TBI. The magnitude of PBA improvement was similar to that reported in patients with PBA secondary to ALS or MS, and the adverse event profile was consistent with the known safety profile of DM/Q.

It has been suggested that growth hormone (GH) may play a regulatory role in male reproductive function. To express full anabolic effect in immature boys testosterone apparently requires the presence of GH. In GH-deficient adults, GH replacement therapy exerts a variety of anabolic actions, some of which are similar to the effects of gonadal steroids. However, little is known about the potential effects of GH on gonadal steroids and on dynamic tests of pituitary-gonadal function in adults with GH deficiency. We evaluated the pituitary-gonadal axis in a 4-month double-blind, placebo-controlled GH study in 13 young males with childhood-onset GH deficiency of which 6 had isolated GH deficiency. GH treatment significantly increased serum levels of total IGF-I from 98 (68) to 323 (126) microg/l, free IGF-I from 0.48 (0.47) to 2.24 (1.66) microg/l, IGFBP-3 from 1,874 (1,178) to 3,520 (778) microg/l and ALS levels from 9,182 (5,524) to 16,872 (6,278) microg/l (all p < 0.0001). We found no differences in basal testosterone levels in the 13 patients between the GH and placebo treatment periods (21.9 (5.1) vs. 24.5 (8.1) nmol/l, nonsignificant). Furthermore, no effect of GH on the testicular response to hCG after 72 h was seen compared to placebo (36.2 (6.4) vs. 38.8 (10.3) nmol/l). In addition, no differences existed in basal SHBG, DHT, free testosterone, delta4-adion and DHEA-S levels. There were no statistically significant differences in maximal FSH and LH response to a GnRH challenge between the GH and the placebo periods (15.7 (5.3) vs. 18.0 (8.8) U/l and 47.0 (26.4) vs. 40.4 (26.5) U/l, respectively). Furthermore, there was no effect on cortisol responses after ACTH between the GH and the placebo periods. However, significantly higher estradiol levels were seen after GH treatment (110 (50) pmol/l) compared to after placebo (89 (34) pmol/l, p = 0.03). Prostate-specific antigen levels decreased after GH treatment compared to after placebo (0.42 (0.54) vs. 0.47 (0.48) microg/l) and this difference almost reached statistical significance (p = 0.059). Inhibin-B levels were significantly lower in hypogonadal patients substituted with androgens, but GH had no effect on inhibin-B levels. In conclusion, GH replacement therapy in 13 GH-deficient young adult males resulted in significant increases in total and free IGF-I as well as in ALS levels in all patients, but had no significant effect on: (1) the pituitary FSH and LH response to GnRH; (2) basal and hCG-stimulated levels of androgens and SHBG; (3) basal inhibin-B levels; (4) ACTH-stimulated cortisol secretion. By contrast, GH administration had subtle anti-androgenic effects in terms of elevated elevated estradiol levels and decreased prostate-specific antigen levels, although both parameters remained within the normal range. Thus, at the level of blood chemistry the effects of GH administration do not appear to involve major alterations in the pituitary-gonadal axis.

Importance: RimabotulinumtoxinB (RIMA) may be preferable as an anti-sialorrhea treatment compared with current oral anticholinergic drugs in people with neurological disorders. Objective: To assess the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of RIMA injections for the treatment of sialorrhea in adults. Design, setting, and participants: This randomized, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of RIMA 2500 U and 3500 U was conducted from November 14, 2013, to January 23, 2017. A total of 249 adult patients with troublesome sialorrhea secondary to any disorder or cause were screened. Of them, 13 refused further participation in the study or were lost to follow-up and 49 did not fulfill the criteria for participation; 187 were ultimately enrolled. Patients had to have a minimum unstimulated salivary flow rate (USFR) of 0.2 g/min and a minimum Drooling Frequency and Severity Scale score of 4. Exposures: Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to RIMA, 2500 U (n = 63); RIMA, 3500 U (n = 64); or placebo (n = 60). Main outcomes and measures: Primary outcomes were the change in USFR from baseline to week 4 and the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) at week 4. The CGI-C scores were recorded on a 7-point scale ranging from very much improved to very much worse. Adverse events were recorded throughout the trial period. Results: Of 187 patients enrolled (147 men [78.6%]; mean [SD] age, 63.9 [13.3] years), 122 patients had Parkinson disease (65.2%), 13 (7.0%) were stroke survivors, 12 had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (6.4%), 6 had medication-induced sialorrhea (3.2%), 4 had adult cerebral palsy (2.1%), and 30 had sialorrhea owing to other causes (16.0%). A total of 176 completed the study. Treatment with both doses of RIMA significantly reduced USFR at week 4 vs placebo (mean treatment difference, -0.30 g/min [95% CI, -0.39 to -0.21] for both doses vs placebo, P < .001). The CGI-C scores were statistically significantly improved at week 4 for both treatment groups vs placebo (-1.21 [95% CI, -1.56 to -0.87] for 2500 U, -1.14 [95% CI, -1.49 to -0.80] for 3500 U, both P < .001). Treatment benefits were seen as early as 1 week after injection and were maintained over the treatment cycle of approximately 13 weeks. The RIMA injections were well tolerated compared with placebo. The most common adverse events were self-limited mild to moderate dry mouth, dysphagia, and dental caries. Conclusions and relevance: Treatment with RIMA (2500 U and 3500 U) in adults was well tolerated and reduced sialorrhea, with the onset of the effect at 1 week after the injection. These data support the clinical use of RIMA in the management of sialorrhea in adults. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01994109.

Objective: The primary aim was to determine the safety of treatment with human immune globulin 10% with recombinant human hyaluronidase (fSCIg) compared to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in a prospective open-label study in patients with multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). Methods: Our study consisted of two phases: the IVIg phase (visits 1-3; 12 weeks), in which patients remained on IVIg treatment, and the fSCIg phase (visits 4-7; 36 weeks), in which patients received fSCIg treatment. After visit 3, IVIg was switched to an equivalent dose and frequency of fSCIg. Outcome measures were safety, muscle strength, disability and treatment satisfaction. Results: Eighteen patients were enrolled in this study. Switching to fSCIg reduced the number of systemic adverse events (IVIg 11.6 vs. fSCIg 5.0 adverse events/per person-year, p < 0.02), and increased the number of local reactions at the injection site (IVIg 0 vs. fSCIg 3.3 local reactions/per person-year, p < 0.01). Overall, no significant differences in muscle strength and disability between fSCIg and IVIg were found. Treatment with fSCIg was perceived as optimal treatment option by 8 of the 17 patients (47.1%) and they continued with fSCIg after study closure because of improved independence and flexibility to administer treatment. Conclusion: Treatment with fSCIg can be considered a safe alternative for patients with MMN on IVIg treatment. fSCIg could be a favorable option in patients who prefer self-treatment and more independency, and in patients who experience systemic adverse events on IVIg or have difficult intravenous access.

Background: We report the initial results from a phase I clinical trial for ALS. We transplanted GMP-grade, fetal human neural stem cells from natural in utero death (hNSCs) into the anterior horns of the spinal cord to test for the safety of both cells and neurosurgical procedures in these patients. The trial was approved by the Istituto Superiore di Sanità and the competent Ethics Committees and was monitored by an external Safety Board. Methods: Six non-ambulatory patients were treated. Three of them received 3 unilateral hNSCs microinjections into the lumbar cord tract, while the remaining ones received bilateral (n = 3 + 3) microinjections. None manifested severe adverse events related to the treatment, even though nearly 5 times more cells were injected in the patients receiving bilateral implants and a much milder immune-suppression regimen was used as compared to previous trials. Results: No increase of disease progression due to the treatment was observed for up to18 months after surgery. Rather, two patients showed a transitory improvement of the subscore ambulation on the ALS-FRS-R scale (from 1 to 2). A third patient showed improvement of the MRC score for tibialis anterior, which persisted for as long as 7 months. The latter and two additional patients refused PEG and invasive ventilation and died 8 months after surgery due to the progression of respiratory failure. The autopsies confirmed that this was related to the evolution of the disease. Conclusions: We describe a safe cell therapy approach that will allow for the treatment of larger pools of patients for later-phase ALS clinical trials, while warranting good reproducibility. These can now be carried out under more standardized conditions, based on a more homogenous repertoire of clinical grade hNSCs. The use of brain tissue from natural miscarriages eliminates the ethical concerns that may arise from the use of fetal material. Trial registration: EudraCT:2009-014484-39 .

Background: Clinical trials to test safety and efficacy of drugs for patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) are currently underway. Biomarkers that document treatment-induced effects are needed because disease progression in childhood forms of SMA is slow and clinical outcome measures may lack sensitivity to detect meaningful changes in motor function in the period of 1-2 years of follow-up during randomized clinical trials. Objective: To determine and compare SMN protein and mRNA levels in two cell types (i.e. PBMCs and skin-derived fibroblasts) from patients with SMA types 1-4 and healthy controls in relation to clinical characteristics and SMN2 copy numbers. Materials and methods: We determined SMN1, SMN2-full length (SMN2-FL), SMN2-delta7 (SMN2-Δ7), GAPDH and 18S mRNA levels and SMN protein levels in blood and fibroblasts from a total of 150 patients with SMA and 293 healthy controls using qPCR and ELISA. We analyzed the association with clinical characteristics including disease severity and duration, and SMN2 copy number. Results: SMN protein levels in PBMCs and fibroblasts were higher in controls than in patients with SMA (p<0.01). Stratification for SMA type did not show differences in SMN protein (p>0.1) or mRNA levels (p>0.05) in either cell type. SMN2 copy number was associated with SMN protein levels in fibroblasts (p = 0.01), but not in PBMCs (p = 0.06). Protein levels in PBMCs declined with age in patients (p<0.01) and controls (p<0.01)(power 1-beta = 0.7). Ratios of SMN2-Δ7/SMN2-FL showed a broad range, primarily explained by the variation in SMN2-Δ7 levels, even in patients with a comparable SMN2 copy number. Levels of SMN2 mRNA did not correlate with SMN2 copy number, SMA type or age in blood (p = 0.7) or fibroblasts (p = 0.09). Paired analysis between blood and fibroblasts did not show a correlation between the two different tissues with respect to the SMN protein or mRNA levels. Conclusions: SMN protein levels differ considerably between tissues and activity is age dependent in patients and controls. SMN protein levels in fibroblasts correlate with SMN2 copy number and have potential as a biomarker for disease severity. Competing Interests: L.

Background: Late-onset Pompe disease is a rare genetic neuromuscular disorder caused by lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency that ultimately results in mobility loss and respiratory failure. Current enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human (rh)GAA has demonstrated efficacy in subjects with late-onset Pompe disease. However, long-term effects of rhGAA on pulmonary function have not been observed, likely related to inefficient delivery of rhGAA to skeletal muscle lysosomes and associated deficits in the central nervous system. To address this limitation, reveglucosidase alfa, a novel insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2)-tagged GAA analogue with improved lysosomal uptake, was developed. This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, safety, and exploratory efficacy of reveglucosidase alfa in 22 subjects with late-onset Pompe disease who were previously untreated with rhGAA. Results: Reveglucosidase alfa plasma concentrations increased linearly with dose, and the elimination half-life was <1.2 h. Eighteen of 22 subjects completed 72 weeks of treatment. The most common adverse events were hypoglycemia (63%), dizziness, fall, headache, and nausea (55% for each). Serious adverse events included hypersensitivity (n = 1), symptomatic hypoglycemia (n = 2), presyncope (n = 1), and acute cardiac failure (n = 1). In the dose-escalation study, all treated subjects tested positive for anti-reveglucosidase alfa, anti-rhGAA, anti-IGF1, and anti-IGF2 antibodies at least once. Subjects receiving 20 mg/kg of reveglucosidase alfa demonstrated increases in predicted maximum inspiratory pressure (13.9%), predicted maximum expiratory pressure (8.0%), forced vital capacity (-0.4%), maximum voluntary ventilation (7.4 L/min), and mean absolute walking distance (22.3 m on the 6-min walk test) at 72 weeks. Conclusions: Additional studies are needed to further assess the safety and efficacy of this approach. Improvements in respiratory muscle strength, lung function, and walking endurance in subjects with LOPD may make up for the risk of hypersensitivity reactions and hypoglycemia. Reveglucosidase alfa may provide a new treatment option for patients with late-onset Pompe disease. Trial registration: ISRCTN01435772 and ISRCTN01230801 , registered 27 October 2011.

Background: Myotonic dystrophy type 1 results from an RNA gain-of-function mutation, in which DM1 protein kinase (DMPK) transcripts carrying expanded trinucleotide repeats exert deleterious effects. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) provide a promising approach to treatment of myotonic dystrophy type 1 because they reduce toxic RNA levels. We aimed to investigate the safety of baliforsen (ISIS 598769), an ASO targeting DMPK mRNA. Methods: In this dose-escalation phase 1/2a trial, adults aged 20-55 years with myotonic dystrophy type 1 were enrolled at seven tertiary referral centres in the USA and randomly assigned via an interactive web or phone response system to subcutaneous injections of baliforsen 100 mg, 200 mg, or 300 mg, or placebo (6:2 randomisation at each dose level), or to baliforsen 400 mg or 600 mg, or placebo (10:2 randomisation at each dose level), on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. Sponsor personnel directly involved with the trial, participants, and all study personnel were masked to treatment assignments. The primary outcome measure was safety in all participants who received at least one dose of study drug up to day 134. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02312011), and is complete. Findings: Between Dec 12, 2014, and Feb 22, 2016, 49 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to baliforsen 100 mg (n=7, one patient not dosed), 200 mg (n=6), 300 mg (n=6), 400 mg (n=10), 600 mg (n=10), or placebo (n=10). The safety population comprised 48 participants who received at least one dose of study drug. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported for 36 (95%) of 38 participants assigned to baliforsen and nine (90%) of ten participants assigned to placebo. Aside from injection-site reactions, common treatment-emergent adverse events were headache (baliforsen: ten [26%] of 38 participants; placebo: four [40%] of ten participants), contusion (baliforsen: seven [18%] of 38; placebo: one [10%] of ten), and nausea (baliforsen: six [16%] of 38; placebo: two [20%] of ten). Most adverse events (baliforsen: 425 [86%] of 494; placebo: 62 [85%] of 73) were mild in severity. One participant (baliforsen 600 mg) developed transient thrombocytopenia considered potentially treatment related. Baliforsen concentrations in skeletal muscle increased with dose. Interpretation: Baliforsen was generally well tolerated. However, skeletal muscle drug concentrations were below levels predicted to achieve substantial target reduction. These results support the further investigation of ASOs as a therapeutic approach for myotonic dystrophy type 1, but suggest improved drug delivery to muscle is needed.

Background: Inclusion body myositis is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy and the most common myopathy affecting people older than 50 years. To date, there are no effective drug treatments. We aimed to assess the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of bimagrumab-a fully human monoclonal antibody-in individuals with inclusion body myositis. Methods: We did a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (RESILIENT) at 38 academic clinical sites in Australia, Europe, Japan, and the USA. Individuals (aged 36-85 years) were eligible for the study if they met modified 2010 Medical Research Council criteria for inclusion body myositis. We randomly assigned participants (1:1:1:1) using a blocked randomisation schedule (block size of four) to either bimagrumab (10 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, or 1 mg/kg) or placebo matched in appearance to bimagrumab, administered as intravenous infusions every 4 weeks for at least 48 weeks. All study participants, the funder, investigators, site personnel, and people doing assessments were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome measure was 6-min walking distance (6MWD), which was assessed at week 52 in the primary analysis population and analysed by intention-to-treat principles. We used a multivariate normal repeated measures model to analyse data for 6MWD. Safety was assessed by recording adverse events and by electrocardiography, echocardiography, haematological testing, urinalysis, and blood chemistry. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01925209; this report represents the final analysis. Findings: Between Sept 26, 2013, and Jan 6, 2016, 251 participants were enrolled to the study, of whom 63 were assigned to each bimagrumab group and 62 were allocated to the placebo group. At week 52, 6MWD change from baseline did not differ between any bimagrumab dose and placebo (least squares mean treatment difference for bimagrumab 10 mg/kg group, 17·6 m, SE 14·3, 99% CI -19·6 to 54·8; p=0·22; for 3 mg/kg group, 18·6 m, 14·2, -18·2 to 55·4; p=0·19; and for 1 mg/kg group, -1·3 m, 14·1, -38·0 to 35·4; p=0·93). 63 (100%) participants in each bimagrumab group and 61 (98%) of 62 in the placebo group had at least one adverse event. Falls were the most frequent adverse event (48 [76%] in the bimagrumab 10 mg/kg group, 55 [87%] in the 3 mg/kg group, 54 [86%] in the 1 mg/kg group, and 52 [84%] in the placebo group). The most frequently reported adverse events with bimagrumab were muscle spasms (32 [51%] in the bimagrumab 10 mg/kg group, 43 [68%] in the 3 mg/kg group, 25 [40%] in the 1 mg/kg group, and 13 [21%] in the placebo group) and diarrhoea (33 [52%], 28 [44%], 20 [32%], and 11 [18%], respectively). Adverse events leading to discontinuation were reported in four (6%) participants in each bimagrumab group compared with one (2%) participant in the placebo group. At least one serious adverse event was reported by 21 (33%) participants in the 10 mg/kg group, 11 (17%) in the 3 mg/kg group, 20 (32%) in the 1 mg/kg group, and 20 (32%) in the placebo group. No significant adverse cardiac effects were recorded on electrocardiography or echocardiography. Two deaths were reported during the study, one attributable to subendocardial myocardial infarction (secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding after an intentional overdose of concomitant sedatives and antidepressants) and one attributable to lung adenocarcinoma. Neither death was considered by the investigator to be related to bimagrumab. Interpretation: Bimagrumab showed a good safety profile, relative to placebo, in individuals with inclusion body myositis but did not improve 6MWD. The strengths of our study are that, to the best of our knowledge, it is the largest randomised controlled trial done in people with inclusion body myositis, and it provides important natural history data over 12 months.

Importance: Many patients with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) have substantial clinical disability, persistent disease burden, and adverse effects attributable to chronic immunosuppression. Therefore, there is a significant need for targeted, well-tolerated therapies with the potential to improve disease control and enhance quality of life. Objective: To evaluate the clinical effects of zilucoplan, a subcutaneously (SC) self-administered macrocyclic peptide inhibitor of complement component 5, in a broad population of patients with moderate to severe gMG. Design, setting, and participants: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial at 25 study sites across North America recruited participants between December 2017 and August 2018. Fifty-seven patients were screened, of whom 12 did not meet inclusion criteria and 1 was lost to follow-up after randomization but before receiving study drug, resulting in a total of 44 acetylcholine receptor autoantibody (AChR-Ab)-positive patients with gMG with baseline Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) scores of at least 12, regardless of treatment history. Interventions: Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to a daily SC self-injection of placebo, 0.1-mg/kg zilucoplan, or 0.3-mg/kg zilucoplan for 12 weeks. Main outcomes and measures: The primary and key secondary end points were the change from baseline to week 12 in QMG and MG Activities of Daily Living scores, respectively. Significance testing was prespecified at a 1-sided α of .10. Safety and tolerability were also assessed. Results: The study of 44 patients was well balanced across the 3 treatment arms with respect to key demographic and disease-specific variables. The mean age of patients across all 3 treatment groups ranged from 45.5 to 54.6 years and most patients were white (average proportions across 3 treatment groups: 78.6%-86.7%). Clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in primary and key secondary efficacy end points were observed. Zilucoplan at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg SC daily resulted in a mean reduction from baseline of 6.0 points in the QMG score (placebo-corrected change, -2.8; P = .05) and 3.4 points in the MG Activities of Daily Living score (placebo-corrected change, -2.3; P = .04). Clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements were also observed in other secondary end points, the MG Composite and MG Quality-of-Life scores. Outcomes for the 0.1-mg/kg SC daily dose were also statistically significant but slower in onset and less pronounced than with the 0.3-mg/kg dose. Rescue therapy (intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange) was required in 3 of 15, 1 of 15, and 0 of 14 participants in the placebo, 0.1-mg/kg zilucoplan, and 0.3-mg/kg zilucoplan arms, respectively. Zilucoplan was observed to have a favorable safety and tolerability profile. Conclusions and relevance: Zilucoplan yielded rapid, meaningful, and sustained improvements over 12 weeks in a broad population of patients with moderate to severe AChR-Ab-positive gMG. Near-complete complement inhibition appeared superior to submaximal inhibition. The observed safety and tolerability profile of zilucoplan was favorable.
