Change from baseline was significantly different in favor of cariprazine versus risperidone on PANSS items N1-N5 (blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive/apathetic social withdrawal, difficulty in abstract thinking) (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ.05), but not on N6 (lack of spontaneity/flow of conversation) or N7 (stereotyped thinking). On all PANSS-derived negative symptom factor models evaluated (PANSS-Factor Score for Negative Symptoms, Liemburg factors, Khan factors, Pentagonal Structure Model Negative Symptom factor), statistically significant improvement was demonstrated for cariprazine versus risperidone (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ.01). Small and similar changes in positive/depressive/EPS symptoms suggested that negative symptom improvement was not pseudospecific.

Epub 2010 Aug 21.,"3-(2,4-dimethoxybenzylidene)-anabaseine (DMXB-A) is a partial agonist at Œ±7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that has been evaluated clinically for treatment of schizophrenia. This study examined the effects of DMXB-A on default network activity as a biomarker for drug effects on pathologic brain function associated with schizophrenia.
Placebo and two doses of DMXB-A were administered in a random, double-blind crossover design during a Phase 2 study of DMXB-A. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 16 nonsmoking patients with schizophrenia while they performed a simple eye movement task. Independent component analysis was used to identify the default network component. Default network changes were evaluated in the context of a polymorphism in CHRNA7, the Œ±7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit gene, which was previously found to be associated with schizophrenia.
Compared with placebo, both 150 and 75 mg twice daily DMXB-A altered default network activity, including a reduction in posterior cingulate, inferior parietal cortex, and medial frontal gyrus activity and an increase in precuneus activity. The most robust difference, posterior cingulate activity reduction, was affected by CHRNA7 genotype.
The observed DMXB-A-related changes are consistent with improved default network function in schizophrenia. Pharmacogenetic analysis indicates mediation of the effect through the Œ±7-nicotinic receptor. These results further implicate nicotinic cholinergic dysfunction in the disease and suggest that default network activity may be a useful indicator of biological effects of novel therapeutic agents.['Adult', 'Benzylidene Compounds / blood', 'Benzylidene Compounds / pharmacology', 'Benzylidene Compounds / therapeutic use*', 'Brain / drug effects', 'Brain Mapping / methods', 'Cognition Disorders / blood', 'Cognition Disorders / complications', 'Cognition Disorders / drug therapy*', 'Cognition Disorders / genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Eye Movements / drug effects', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging / methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neural Pathways / drug effects*', 'Nicotinic Agonists / pharmacology', 'Nicotinic Agonists / therapeutic use*', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Pyridines / blood', 'Pyridines / pharmacology', 'Pyridines / therapeutic use*', 'Receptors, Nicotinic / genetics*', 'Schizophrenia / blood', 'Schizophrenia / complications', 'Schizophrenia / drug therapy*', 'Schizophrenia / genetics', 'alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor']","3-(2,4-dimethoxybenzylidene)-anabaseine (DMXB-A) is a partial agonist at Œ±7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that has been evaluated clinically for treatment of schizophrenia.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 16 nonsmoking patients with schizophrenia while they performed a simple eye movement task. Independent component analysis was used to identify the default network component. Default network changes were evaluated in the context of a polymorphism in CHRNA7, the Œ±7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit gene, which was previously found to be associated with schizophrenia.
Compared with placebo, both 150 and 75 mg twice daily DMXB-A altered default network activity, including a reduction in posterior cingulate, inferior parietal cortex, and medial frontal gyrus activity and an increase in precuneus activity. The most robust difference, posterior cingulate activity reduction, was affected by CHRNA7 genotype.
The observed DMXB-A-related changes are consistent with improved default network function in schizophrenia. Pharmacogenetic analysis indicates mediation of the effect through the Œ±7-nicotinic receptor. These results further implicate nicotinic cholinergic dysfunction in the disease and suggest that default network activity may be a useful indicator of biological effects of novel therapeutic agents.","['Adult', 'Benzylidene Compounds / blood', 'Benzylidene Compounds / pharmacology', 'Benzylidene Compounds / therapeutic use*', 'Brain / drug effects', 'Brain Mapping / methods', 'Cognition Disorders / blood', 'Cognition Disorders / complications', 'Cognition Disorders / drug therapy*', 'Cognition Disorders / genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Eye Movements / drug effects', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging / methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neural Pathways / drug effects*', 'Nicotinic Agonists / pharmacology', 'Nicotinic Agonists / therapeutic use*', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Pyridines / blood', 'Pyridines / pharmacology', 'Pyridines / therapeutic use*', 'Receptors, Nicotinic / genetics*', 'Schizophrenia / blood', 'Schizophrenia / complications', 'Schizophrenia / drug therapy*', 'Schizophrenia / genetics', 'alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor']",Phase 2

We probed the implications of the partial D2 receptor agonist actions of aripiprazole within the DLPFC during working memory. Investigations were carried out in healthy volunteers to eliminate confounds of illness or medication status. Aripiprazole's prefrontal actions were compared with the D2/5-HT2A blocker risperidone to separate aripiprazole's unique prefrontal D2 agonist actions from its serotinergic and striatal D2 actions that it shares with risperidone.

Compared with placebo, the aripiprazole group demonstrated enhanced DLPFC activation associated with a trend for improved discriminability (d') and speeded reaction times. In contrast to aripiprazole's neural effects, the risperidone group demonstrated a trend for reduced DLPFC recruitment. Unexpectedly, the risperidone group demonstrated similar effects to aripiprazole on d' and additionally had reduced errors of commission compared with placebo.

Scores on the BPRS and SAS were improved during treatment with tandospirone, but the effects did not reach statistical significance.
The results suggest that adjunctive treatment with 5-HT(1A) agonists may improve some types of memory function in schizophrenia.","['Adult', 'Basal Ganglia Diseases / diagnosis', 'Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale', 'Cognition Disorders / diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Memory / drug effects*', 'Schizophrenia / diagnosis', 'Schizophrenia / drug therapy*', 'Serotonin Receptor Agonists / pharmacology*', 'Serotonin Receptor Agonists / therapeutic use*', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Wechsler Scales']",Not Found

To test this hypothesis, a GABA deficit was induced by intravenous infusion of iomazenil (IOM; 3.7‚ÄâŒºg/kg), an antagonist and partial inverse agonist of benzodiazepine receptor. A subthreshold dose of AMPH (0.1‚Äâmg/kg) was administered by intravenous infusion. Healthy subjects received placebo IOM followed by placebo AMPH, active IOM followed by placebo AMPH, placebo IOM followed by active AMPH, and active IOM followed by active AMPH in a randomized, double-blind crossover design over 4 test days. Twelve healthy subjects who had a subclinical response to active AMPH alone were included in the analysis. Psychotomimetic effects (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)), perceptual alterations (Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptoms Scale (CADSS)), and subjective effects (visual analog scale) were captured before and after the administration of drugs. IOM significantly augmented AMPH-induced peak changes in PANSS positive symptom subscale and both subjective and objective CADSS scores. There were no pharmacokinetic interactions. In conclusion, GABA deficits increased vulnerability to amphetamine-induced psychosis-relevant effects in healthy subjects, suggesting that pre-existing GABA deficits may explain why a subgroup of schizophrenia patients are vulnerable to AMPH.['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amphetamine / administration & dosage*', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Flumazenil / administration & dosage', 'Flumazenil / analogs & derivatives', 'Hallucinogens / administration & dosage*', 'Healthy Volunteers', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Psychotic Disorders / drug therapy*', 'Psychotic Disorders / etiology*', 'Time Factors', 'Visual Analog Scale', 'Young Adult', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid / deficiency*']","Some schizophrenia patients are more sensitive to amphetamine (AMPH)-induced exacerbations in psychosis-an effect that correlates with higher striatal dopamine release.

Assessments of safety and tolerability included spontaneously reported adverse events, extrapyramidal symptom scores, serum prolactin concentration, body weight, and metabolic measures.
Of 302 patients, 85% completed the 6-week study. The mean baseline PANSS score was 94.1. At the end of the study, both aripiprazole doses showed statistically significant differences from placebo in reduction in PANSS total score. Adverse events occurring in more than 5% of either aripiprazole group and with a combined incidence at least twice the rate for placebo were extrapyramidal disorder, somnolence, and tremor. Mean changes in prolactin were -8.45, -11.93, and -15.14 ng/ml for placebo and 10 mg and 30 mg of aripirazole, respectively. Mean body weight changes were -0.8, 0.0, and 0.2 kg for placebo and 10 mg and 30 mg of aripiprazole, respectively.
Both 10- and 30-mg/day doses of aripiprazole were superior to placebo in the acute treatment of adolescents with schizophrenia. Aripiprazole was generally well tolerated.","['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Antipsychotic Agents / adverse effects', 'Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use*', 'Aripiprazole', 'Basal Ganglia Diseases / chemically induced', 'Body Weight / drug effects', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Piperazines / adverse effects', 'Piperazines / therapeutic use*', 'Prolactin / blood', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Quinolones / adverse effects', 'Quinolones / therapeutic use*', 'Schizophrenia / diagnosis', 'Schizophrenia / drug therapy*', 'Schizophrenic Psychology*', 'Treatment Outcome']",Phase 3

This pilot study randomly assigned patients with schizophrenia (N=40) to either aripiprazole or risperidone. After 6 weeks of treatment, the severity of negative symptoms was determined by the PANSS. Subscales of self-report questionnaires were used to assess differences in initiative, anhedonia, social functioning and subjective well-being.
Patients treated with aripiprazole showed a significant improvement on measures for anhedonia and subjective wellbeing. Negative symptoms in general, lack of initiative and social inhibition were also lower in the aripiprazole treated group, but without reaching statistical significance.
According to this pilot study, aripiprazole appears to specifically improve anhedonia and subjective wellbeing compared to risperidone.

Since aripiprazole acts as an antagonist at HTR2A, genetic variants of HTR2A may be important in explaining variability in response to aripiprazole.
This study investigated whether the efficacy of aripiprazole can be predicted by functional HTR2A A-1438G/T102C polymorphisms (rs63311/rs6313) as modified by clinical factors in Han Chinese hospitalized patients with acutely exacerbated schizophrenia.
After hospitalization, the patients (n = 128) were given a 4-week course of aripiprazole. Patients were genotyped for HTR2A A-1438G/T102C polymorphisms via the restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Clinical factors such as gender, age, duration of illness, education level, diagnostic subtype, and medication dosage were noted as well. The researchers measured psychopathology biweekly, using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). A mixed model regression approach (SAS Proc MIXED) was used to analyze the effects of genetic and clinical factors on PANSS performance after aripiprazole treatment.
We found that the GG/CC genotype group of HTR2A A-1438G/T102C polymorphisms predicts poor aripiprazole response specifically for negative symptoms.

This Phase II trial evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cariprazine versus placebo in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder.
This was a multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose study of cariprazine 3-12¬†mg/day in patients with acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. Following washout, patients received three weeks of double-blind treatment. The primary and secondary efficacy parameters were change from baseline to Week 3 in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) scores, respectively. Post-hoc analysis evaluated changes on YMRS single items.
In each group, 118 patients received double-blind treatment; 61.9% of placebo and 63.6% of cariprazine patients completed the study. The overall mean daily dose of cariprazine was 8.8¬†mg/day.

This randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted between May 2010 and August 2012. One hundred twenty antipsychotic-treated inpatients from 34 psychiatric hospitals in Japan were included. Patients were randomized to adjuvant treatment with YKS 7.5 g/day or placebo. During a 4-week follow-up, psychopathology was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) with five factors [excitement/hostility (P4, P7, G8, and G14), depression/anxiety (G1, G2, G3, G4, and G6), cognition (P2, N5, N7, G5, G10, G11, G12, G13, and G15], positive (P1, P3, P5, P6, and G9), and negative (N1, N2, N3, N4, N6, G7, and G16]]. Other assessments included, Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), and Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS). The primary efficacy outcome was the change in PANSS five-factor scores. The secondary outcomes were changes in the scores of CGI-S. The analysis was made on a modified intention to treat basis with the help of a last observation carried forward method.
YKS showed a tendency of superiority to placebo in reducing total all PANSS five-factor scores in treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but the difference was not statistically significant in total, depression/anxiety, cognition, positive, and negative factors. However, compared to the placebo group, the YKS group showed statistically significant improvements in the PANSS excitement/hostility factor scores (p<0.05). No substantial side effects were recorded.
The results of the present study indicate YKS to be a potential adjunctive treatment strategy for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, particularly to improve excitement/hostility symptoms.['Adult', 'Antipsychotic Agents / adverse effects', 'Antipsychotic Agents / therapeutic use*', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal / adverse effects', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal / therapeutic use*', 'Factor Analysis, Statistical', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases / chemically induced', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases / epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Japan / epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales* / statistics & numerical data', 'Schizophrenia / diagnosis', 'Schizophrenia / drug therapy*', 'Schizophrenia / epidemiology']","Treating schizophrenia patients who fail to respond to antipsychotics is a major challenge, and the percentage of treatment-resistant patients is estimated to be 20-25 %.

According to the study design, eight buspirone non-responders were switched to the 5-HT2A/2C antagonist mianserin (15 mg/day) for the other 4 days of treatment (second part of the study). Seven mianserin-treated patients improved and five revealed complete disappearance of neuroleptic-induced akathisia. It seems that the 5-HT1A partial agonist buspirone is of limited value in the treatment of acute neuroleptic-induced akathisia. It contrast, it appears that low-dose mianserin is therapeutically effective in acute neuroleptic-induced akathisia.","['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Akathisia, Drug-Induced / drug therapy*', 'Akathisia, Drug-Induced / etiology', 'Antipsychotic Agents / adverse effects*', 'Buspirone / therapeutic use*', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mianserin / therapeutic use*', 'Middle Aged', 'Schizophrenia / drug therapy', 'Serotonin Agents / therapeutic use*']",Not Found

Epub 2004 Oct 21.,"D-Cycloserine, a partial agonist at the glycine site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, has demonstrated inconsistent efficacy for negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. The strongest evidence for efficacy has come from studies using D-cycloserine at a dose of 50 mg/day added to conventional antipsychotics in trials of 8 weeks duration or less.
To assess the efficacy for negative symptoms and cognitive impairment of D-cycloserine augmentation of conventional antipsychotics in a 6-month trial.
Fifty-five schizophrenia patients with prominent negative symptoms, treated with conventional antipsychotics, were randomly assigned to treatment with D-cycloserine 50 mg/day or placebo for 6 months in a double-blind, parallel group design.
Twenty-six subjects completed the 6-month trial; drop-out rates did not differ between treatment groups. D-Cycloserine treatment did not differ from placebo treatment on any primary outcome measure at 8 or 24 weeks, including response of negative symptoms and performance on a cognitive battery. Serum D-cycloserine concentrations did not correlate with response of negative symptoms.
D-Cycloserine did not exhibit therapeutic effects in this trial, possibly reflecting the high drop-out rate, a narrow range of therapeutic serum concentrations, a modest magnitude of therapeutic effect for the selected outcome measures, or loss of efficacy over time. Because D-cycloserine is a partial agonist with relatively low affinity for the glycine site, the magnitude of potential therapeutic effect may be smaller than that achieved by the higher-affinity full agonists, glycine and D-serine.['Adult', 'Antipsychotic Agents / administration & dosage*', 'Cycloserine / administration & dosage*', 'Cycloserine / blood', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Schizophrenia / drug therapy*', 'Treatment Outcome']","D-Cycloserine, a partial agonist at the glycine site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, has demonstrated inconsistent efficacy for negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.
