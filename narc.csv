Histamine neurons are crucial to maintain wakefulness. We assessed the safety and efficacy of pitolisant (previously called BF2.649), a selective histamine H3 receptor inverse agonist that activates these neurons, in patients with narcolepsy.
For this double-blind, randomised, parallel-group controlled trial, we recruited patients with narcolepsy from 32 sleep disorder centres in five European countries. Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, had not taken psychostimulants for at least 14 days, and had EDS (defined as an Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS] score of at least 14). Using a computer-generated randomisation sequence, we randomly allocated patients to receive pitolisant, modafinil, or placebo (1:1:1). Treatment lasted 8 weeks: 3 weeks of flexible dosing according to investigator's judgment (10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg a day of pitolisant; 100 mg, 200 mg or 400 mg a day of modafinil) followed by 5 weeks of stable dosing. Patients took four tablets a day in a double-dummy design to ensure masking. For the primary analysis, assessed in the intention-to-treat population, we assessed the superiority of pitolisant versus placebo, and the non-inferiority of pitolisant versus modafinil. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01067222.
Between May 26, 2009, and June 30, 2010, we screened 110 patients, 95 of whom were eligible and randomly assigned to treatment: 30 to placebo, 32 to pitolisant, and 33 to modafinil. Over the 8-week treatment period, mean ESS score reductions were -3·4 (SD 4·2) in the placebo group, -5·8 (6·2) in the pitolisant group, and -6·9 (6·2) in the modafinil group. Our primary analysis of between-group differences in mean ESS score at endpoint (adjusted for baseline) showed pitolisant to be superior to placebo (difference -3·0, 95% CI -5·6 to -0·4; p=0·024), but not non-inferior to modafinil (difference 0·12, 95% CI -2·5 to 2·7; p=0·250). We recorded 22 adverse events with pitolisant, 26 with modafinil, and ten with placebo. Six severe adverse events were treatment-related: one with pitolisant (abdominal discomfort) and five with modafinil (abdominal pain, abnormal behaviour, amphetamine-like withdrawal symptoms, lymphoadenopathy, and inner ear disorders).
Pitolisant at doses up to 40 mg was efficacious on EDS compared with placebo and well tolerated compared with modafinil. If these findings are substantiated in further studies, pitolisant could offer a new treatment option for patients with narcolepsy.

Nondependent, recreational stimulant users able to distinguish phentermine HCl 60 mg from placebo in a drug discrimination test were randomized in a four-period, double-blind, crossover design to receive single doses of pitolisant 35.6 mg (therapeutic dose), pitolisant 213.6 mg (supratherapeutic dose), phentermine HCl 60 mg, and placebo. The primary endpoint was maximum effect (Emax) on the 100-point Drug Liking (""at this moment"") visual analog scale.
In 38 study completers (73.7% male; 65.8% white; mean age, 33.3 years), mean Drug Liking Emax was significantly greater for phentermine versus pitolisant 35.6 mg (mean difference, 21.4; p < 0.0001) and pitolisant 213.6 mg (mean difference, 19.7; p < 0.0001). Drug Liking Emax was similar for pitolisant (both doses) and placebo. Similarly, for key secondary measures of Overall Drug Liking and willingness to Take Drug Again, mean Emax scores were significantly greater for phentermine versus pitolisant (both doses) and similar for pitolisant (both doses) versus placebo. The incidence of adverse events was 82.1% after phentermine HCl 60 mg, 72.5% after pitolisant 213.6 mg, 47.5% after pitolisant 35.6 mg, and 48.8% after placebo administration.
In this study, pitolisant demonstrated significantly lower potential for abuse compared with phentermine and an overall profile similar to placebo; this suggests a low risk of abuse for pitolisant.

The hypothesis that the orexin defect can be circumvented by enhancing HA release was explored in narcoleptic mice and patients using tiprolisant, an inverse H(3)-receptor agonist. In narcoleptic orexin(-/-) mice, tiprolisant enhanced HA and noradrenaline neuronal activity, promoted wakefulness and decreased abnormal DREMs, all effects being amplified by co-administration of modafinil, a currently-prescribed wake-promoting drug. In a pilot single-blind trial on 22 patients receiving a placebo followed by tiprolisant, both for 1 week, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score was reduced from a baseline value of 17.6 by 1.0 with the placebo (p>0.05) and 5.9 with tiprolisant (p<0.001).

Studies now aim to investigate the optimal dose of enerisant, a novel H3 antagonist/inverse agonist, for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy.
We conducted two phase 2, fixed-dose, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in patients with narcolepsy. The first phase 2 study (Study 1) was conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of enerisant at dosages of 25, 50, and 100 mg/day administered for 3 weeks based on the results of a phase 1 study conducted on healthy volunteers. The primary endpoint was mean sleep latency in maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT), and the secondary endpoint was the total score on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). The dosages of enerisant in the second phase 2 study (Study 2) were set at 5 and 10 mg/day based on the simulation of receptor occupancy results from positron emission tomography study.
Forty-six and fifty-three patients were randomized in Study 1 and Study 2, respectively. The efficacy of enerisant was partially confirmed in Study 1 with ESS; however, the doses were not tolerated, and there were many withdrawals due to adverse events (mainly insomnia, headache, and nausea). The doses in Study 2 were well tolerated, with a lower incidence of adverse events in Study 2 than in Study 1, although the efficacy could not be confirmed with MWT and ESS in Study 2.
The optimal dose of enerisant could not be determined in these two studies. Although enerisant has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, it is thought to have large interindividual variabilities in terms of efficacy and safety, suggesting the necessity of tailored dosage adjustments.

The efficacy and safety of pitolisant have been demonstrated in randomized placebo-controlled trials. When evaluating the results of randomized placebo-controlled trials, the clinical impact of a treatment can be assessed using effect size metrics that include Cohen's d (the standardized mean difference of an effect) and number needed to treat (NNT; number of patients that need to be treated to achieve a specific outcome for one person).
The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical impact of pitolisant for the reduction in excessive daytime sleepiness or cataplexy in adults with narcolepsy.
This post hoc analysis incorporated data from two 7-week or 8-week randomized placebo-controlled trials (HARMONY 1, HARMONY CTP). Study medication was individually titrated, with a maximum possible pitolisant dose of 35.6 mg/day. Efficacy was assessed using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and weekly rate of cataplexy (HARMONY CTP only). Cohen's d was derived from the least-squares mean difference between treatment groups (pitolisant vs placebo), and NNTs were calculated from response rates. Treatment response was defined for excessive daytime sleepiness in two ways: (a) reduction in ESS score ≥ 3 or final ESS score ≤ 10 and (b) final ESS score ≤ 10. Treatment response was defined for cataplexy as a ≥ 25%, ≥ 50%, or ≥ 75% reduction in weekly rate of cataplexy.
The analysis population included 61 patients in HARMONY 1 (pitolisant, n = 31; placebo, n = 30) and 105 patients in HARMONY CTP (pitolisant, n = 54; placebo, n = 51). For pitolisant vs placebo, Cohen's d effect size values were 0.61 (HARMONY 1) and 0.86 (HARMONY CTP) based on changes in ESS scores, and 0.86 (HARMONY CTP) based on changes in weekly rate of cataplexy. NNTs for pitolisant were 3-5 for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness and 3-4 for the treatment of cataplexy.
The results of this analysis demonstrate the robust efficacy of pitolisant for the reduction in both excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. These large effect sizes and low NNTs provide further evidence supporting the strength of the clinical response to pitolisant in the treatment of adults with narcolepsy.

However, GHB is also abused for its prohedonic effects. On a neuronal level, it was shown that GHB increases regional cerebral blood flow in limbic areas such as the right anterior insula (rAI) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). We aimed to further explore the association between the subjective and neuronal signatures of GHB.
We assessed subjective effects and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of an rAI- and an ACC-seed in 19 healthy male subjects after GHB (35 mg/kg p.o.) using a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, cross-over functional magnet resonance imaging design.
GHB increased subjective ratings for euphoria (p < 0.001) and sexual arousal (p < 0.01). Moreover, GHB increased rAI-rsFC to the right thalamus and the superior frontal gyrus and decreased ACC-rsFC to the bilateral paracentral lobule (all p < 0.05, cluster corrected). Moreover, GHB-induced euphoria was associated with rAI-rsFC to the superior frontal gyrus (p < 0.05, uncorrected).
GHB induces prohedonic effects such as euphoria and sexual arousal and in parallel modulates limbic rsFC with areas linked to regulation of mood, cognitive control, and sexual experience. These results further elucidate the drug's effects in neuropsychiatric disorders and as drug of abuse.Adult Cerebral Cortex / diagnostic imaging Cerebral Cortex / drug effects* Cerebral Cortex / physiology Connectome / methods* Cross-Over Studies Double-Blind Method Euphoria / drug effects* GABA-B Receptor Agonists / administration & dosage GABA-B Receptor Agonists / pharmacology* Gyrus Cinguli / diagnostic imaging Gyrus Cinguli / drug effects Gyrus Cinguli / physiology Humans Libido / drug effects* Limbic System / diagnostic imaging Limbic System / drug effects* Limbic System / physiology Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Sodium Oxybate / administration & dosage Sodium Oxybate / pharmacology* Young Adult",2018 Nov

Two oral doses of GHB (25 and 35 mg kg(-1) ) were administered to 32 healthy male subjects (16 for each dose) using a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over design.
Maximal concentrations of GHB were (geometric mean and 95% CI): 218 (176-270) nmol ml(-1) and 453 (374-549) nmol ml(-1) for the 25 and 35 mg kg(-1) GHB doses, respectively.

Thus, plasma GHB exposure (AUC0-∞ ) rose disproportionally (+40%) with the higher dose. γ-Hydroxybutyrate produced mixed stimulant-sedative effects, with a dose-dependent increase in sedation and dizziness. It did not alter heart rate or blood pressure. A close relationship between plasma GHB exposure and its psychotropic effects was found, with higher GHB concentrations associated with higher subjective stimulation, sedation, and dizziness. No clockwise hysteresis was observed in the GHB concentration effect plot over time (i.e., no acute pharmacological tolerance).
Evidence was found of a nonlinear dose-exposure relationship (i.e., no dose proportionality) at moderate doses of GHB. The effects of GHB on consciousness were closely linked to its plasma exposure and exhibited no acute tolerance.Administration, Oral Adult Blood Pressure / drug effects Cross-Over Studies Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Drug Tolerance GABA Agonists / administration & dosage GABA Agonists / pharmacokinetics GABA Agonists / pharmacology* Healthy Volunteers Heart Rate / drug effects Humans Hypnotics and Sedatives / administration & dosage Hypnotics and Sedatives / pharmacokinetics Hypnotics and Sedatives / pharmacology* Male Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Psychotropic Drugs / administration & dosage Psychotropic Drugs / pharmacokinetics Psychotropic Drugs / pharmacology* Sodium Oxybate / administration & dosage Sodium Oxybate / pharmacokinetics Sodium Oxybate / pharmacology* Substance Withdrawal Syndrome / drug therapy* Young Adult",2016 May

Tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs), the cortisol-awakening response (CAR), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have been suggested as peripheral biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. GHB has been shown to induce a delayed reduction of T helper and natural killer cell counts and alter basal cortisol levels, but GHB's effects on TRYCATs, CAR, and BDNF are unknown.
Therefore, TRYCAT and BDNF serum levels, as well as CAR and the affective state (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule [PANAS]) were measured in the morning after a single nocturnal dose of GHB (50 mg/kg body weight) in 20 healthy male volunteers in a placebo-controlled, balanced, randomized, double-blind, cross-over design.
In the morning after nocturnal GHB administration, the TRYCATs indolelactic acid, kynurenine, kynurenic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine, and quinolinic acid; the 3-hydroxykynurenine to kynurenic acid ratio; and the CAR were significantly reduced (P < 0.05-0.001, Benjamini-Hochberg corrected). The quinolinic acid to kynurenic acid ratio was reduced by trend. Serotonin, tryptophan, and BDNF levels, as well as PANAS scores in the morning, remained unchanged after a nocturnal GHB challenge.

Pitolisant, a selective histamine H3 receptor inverse agonist, has been approved in Europe and USA for adults with narcolepsy with or without cataplexy, with a favourable safety profile. This phase 3 study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of pitolisant in children with narcolepsy with or without cataplexy.
For this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multisite study, we recruited patients aged 6-17 years with narcolepsy with or without cataplexy in 11 sleep centres in five countries (Italy, France, Netherlands, Russia, and Finland). Participants were required to have a Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale score of 15 or greater and to have not received psychostimulants for at least 14 days before enrolment; participants who needed anticataplectics (including sodium oxybate) were required to have been on a stable dose for at least 1 month. Participants were randomly assigned to treatment with pitolisant or placebo in a 2:1 ratio at the end of screening. Randomisation was stratified by study centre and treatment was allocated using an interactive web response system. After a 4-week screening period including a 2-week baseline period, patients entered in a 4-week individual up-titration scheme from 5 mg a day to a maximum of 40 mg a day of pitolisant or placebo; treatment was administered at a stable dose for 4 weeks, followed by a 1-week placebo period. For the primary analysis, we assessed pitolisant versus placebo using change in the Ullanlinna Narcolepsy Scale (UNS) total score from baseline to the end of double-blind period in the full analysis set, defined as all randomly allocated patients who received at least one dose of treatment and who had at least one baseline UNS value. A decrease in the UNS total score reflects a reduction in both excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. All adverse events were assessed in the safety population, defined as all participants who took at least one dose of study medication. An open-label follow-up is ongoing. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02611687.
Between June 6, 2016, and April 3, 2021, we screened 115 participants and 110 were randomly assigned (mean age 12·9 [SD 3·0] years, 61 [55%] male, and 90 [82%] with cataplexy; 72 assigned to pitolisant and 38 to placebo); 107 (70 receiving pitolisant and 37 receiving placebo) completed the double-blind period. The mean adjusted difference in UNS total score from baseline to the end of the double-blind period was -6·3 (SE 1·1) in the pitolisant group and -2·6 (1·4) in the placebo group (least squares mean difference -3·7; 95% CI -6·4 to -1·0, p=0·007). Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 22 (31%) of 72 patients in the pitolisant group and 13 (34%) of 38 patients in the placebo group. The most frequently reported adverse events (affecting ≥5% of patients) in either group were headache (14 [19%] in the pitolisant group and three [8%] in the placebo group) and insomnia (five [7%] in the pitolisant group and one [3%] in the placebo group).
Pitolisant treatment resulted in an improvement in narcolepsy symptoms in children, although the UNS was not validated for use in children with narcolepsy when our study began. The safety profile was similar to that reported in adults but further studies are needed to confirm long-term safety.

SO was shown to increase slow wave sleep (SWS) and EEG delta power (0.75-4.5 Hz), both indexes of NREM sleep (NREMS) intensity and depth, suggesting that SO enhances recuperative function of NREM. We investigated whether SO induces physiological deep sleep.
SO was administered before an afternoon nap or before the subsequent experimental night in 13 healthy volunteers. The effects of SO were compared to baclofen (BAC), another GABAβ receptor agonist, to assess the role of GABAβ receptors in the SO response.
As expected, a nap significantly decreased sleep need and intensity the subsequent night. Both drugs reversed this nap effect on the subsequent night by decreasing sleep latency and increasing total sleep time, SWS during the first NREMS episode, and EEG delta and theta (0.75-7.25 Hz) power during NREMS. The SO-induced increase in EEG delta and theta power was, however, not specific to NREMS and was also observed during REM sleep (REMS) and wakefulness. Moreover, the high levels of delta power during a nap following SO administration did not affect delta power the following night. SO and BAC taken before the nap did not improve subsequent psychomotor performance and subjective alertness, or memory consolidation. Finally, SO and BAC strongly promoted the appearance of sleep onset REM periods.
The SO-induced EEG slow waves seem not to be functionally similar to physiological slow waves. Our findings also suggest a role for GABAβ receptors in REMS generation.Adult Baclofen / pharmacology* Electroencephalography* GABA-B Receptor Agonists / pharmacology Humans Male Memory / drug effects* Memory / physiology Polysomnography Psychomotor Performance / drug effects Receptors, GABA-B / metabolism Sleep / drug effects* Sleep / physiology Sleep Stages / drug effects Sleep Stages / physiology Sodium Oxybate / pharmacology* Time Factors Wakefulness / drug effects Wakefulness / physiology Young Adult",2012 Aug 1

It is used as treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders including narcolepsy and alcohol withdrawal, but is also a drug of abuse. Non-medical users report enhancement of body and emotion awareness during intoxication. However, the neuronal underpinnings of such awareness alterations under GHB are unknown so far. The assessment of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) by pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) enables the elucidation of drug-induced functional brain alterations. Thus, we assessed the effects of GHB (35 mg/kg p.o.) in 17 healthy males on rCBF and subjective drug effects, using a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, cross-over design employing arterial spin labeling phMRI. Compared to placebo, GHB increased subjective ratings for body and emotion awareness, and for dizziness (p<0.01-0.001, Bonferroni-corrected). A whole-brain analysis showed increased rCBF in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the right anterior insula under GHB (p<0.05, cluster-corrected). ACC and insula rCBF are correlated with relaxation, and body and emotion awareness (p<0.05-0.001, uncorrected). Interaction analyses revealed that GHB-induced increase of body awareness was accompanied by increased rCBF in ACC, whereas relaxation under GHB was accompanied by elevated rCBF in right anterior insula (p<0.05, uncorrected). In conclusion, enhancement of emotion and body awareness, and increased perfusion of insula and ACC bears implications both for the properties of GHB as a drug of abuse as well as for its putative personalized potential for specific therapeutic indications in affective disorders.Adult Analysis of Variance Anesthetics, Intravenous / pharmacology* Awareness / drug effects* Cerebrovascular Circulation / drug effects* Cross-Over Studies Double-Blind Method Emotions / drug effects* Female Humans Image Processing, Computer-Assisted Limbic System / diagnostic imaging Limbic System / drug effects* Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Oxygen / blood Rest Sodium Oxybate / pharmacology* Whole Body Imaging Young Adult",2017 Oct

In addition, two patients underwent polysomnography (PSG) and multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT) while on and 2 weeks after discontinuation of pramipexole. Forty patients with PD participating in pramipexole clinical trials were identified. In the double-blind phases of the studies, 22 patients were randomized to pramipexole and 18 were randomized to placebo. Six patients assigned to pramipexole reported somnolence as an adverse event (1 moderate, 5 mild) compared with two patients assigned to placebo (1 severe, 1 moderate; p = 0.19, one-tailed Fisher's exact test). Thirty-seven patients participated in open-label extension studies. Twenty-one (57%) reported somnolence as an adverse event. Eleven (30%) patients reported moderate somnolence and three (8%) patients reported severe somnolence. For patients with moderate or severe somnolence, the onset of worst-reported somnolence occurred at a mean (+/- standard error) pramipexole dose of 4.0 +/- 0.4 mg (range, 0.75-4.5 mg) per day. Patients had been taking pramipexole for a total of 10.0 +/- 1.5 months (range, .03-22 mos) and at their maximal dose for 6.7 +/- 1.5 months (range, .03-20 mos). During structured interviews with 12 of the 14 patients reporting moderate or severe somnolence, seven reported falling asleep while driving and two reported minor motor vehicle accidents caused by falling asleep. Most patients reported relatively continuous drowsiness that led to falling asleep without acute warning during periods of inactivity. Three patients reported discreet waves of irresistible sleepiness heralded by prodromal symptoms occurring against a background of normal wakefulness. MSLT in two of these patients revealed decreased latency to sleep without early onset of rapid eye movements. Sleep latency normalized after withdrawal of pramipexole. Intensive patient education is necessary to prevent motor vehicle accidents in patients taking pramipexole. We recommend that patients who are experiencing generalized drowsiness and falling asleep during periods of inactivity be instructed not to drive because these patients do fall asleep without acute warning. Somnolence usually resolves with pramipexole dose reduction or discontinuation. Patients should also be alerted to pull over and stop driving immediately if they feel a wave of sleepiness coming on.

Because treatment of insomnia in older adults is challenging and has limited options, the purpose of the current analysis was to further analyse the phase III trial studying the higher doses of daridorexant, those that showed efficacy (daridorexant 50 mg, daridorexant 25 mg and placebo, nightly for 3 months), and compare the safety and efficacy of daridorexant in patients aged ≥ 65 ('older adults') to those aged < 65 years ('younger adults').
Analyses by age (≥ 65 years, n = 364; < 65 years, n = 566) were performed on data from the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Trial 1 in adult patients with insomnia (NCT03545191). Efficacy endpoints included a change from baseline at month 1 and month 3 in polysomnography-measured wake after sleep onset (WASO) and latency to persistent sleep (LPS), self-reported total sleep time (sTST) and daytime functioning assessed using the validated Insomnia Daytime Symptoms and Impacts Questionnaire (IDSIQ). Safety endpoints included adverse events and the Visual Analog Scale for morning sleepiness.
At baseline, mean [standard deviation] WASO was numerically greater (110 [39] vs 92 [38] min) in older than younger adults, while LPS was comparable (~ 65 min). Mean baseline IDSIQ total and all domain scores were numerically lower (i.e. better) in older adults. Daridorexant caused similar reductions in WASO and LPS, and similar increases in sTST, from baseline, in both age groups; improvements were numerically greater with daridorexant 50 mg than 25 mg. At month 3, daridorexant 50 mg, compared with placebo, decreased WASO by a least-squares mean of 19.6 (95% confidence interval 9.7, 29.5) in older patients versus 17.4 min (10.7, 24.0) in younger patients and decreased LPS by a least-squares mean of 14.9 (7.5, 22.3) in older patients versus 9.7 min (3.7, 15.7) in younger patients. Daridorexant 50 mg increased sTST from baseline to month 3 by a least-squares mean of 59.9 (49.6, 70.3) in older patients versus 57.1 min (48.9, 65.3) in younger patients. Daridorexant 50 mg progressively improved IDSIQ total and domain scores from week 1 onwards similarly in both groups; daridorexant 25 mg improved IDSIQ scores, but only in younger adults. In both age groups, in comparison with placebo, the overall incidence of adverse events was comparable, and there were fewer falls on daridorexant. Daridorexant improved Visual Analog Scale morning sleepiness in both groups; daridorexant 50 mg increased the mean (standard deviation) Visual Analog Scale morning sleepiness score by 15.9 (20.7) in older adults and by 14.9 (18.7) in younger adults from baseline to month 3. In older adults, there was one case of sleep paralysis, and no cases of narcolepsy, cataplexy, or complex sleep behaviour.
In older patients with insomnia, as in younger patients, the efficacy of daridorexant is maximal on night-time and daytime variables at the higher dose of 50 mg. Older patients particularly require this dose to improve daytime functioning. Older patients are not at an increased risk of adverse events or residual effects the next morning after night-time administration of daridorexant, even at 50 mg. The dose of daridorexant does not need to be decreased for older patients.

The burden of chronic insomnia (difficulty in falling/staying asleep or not getting enough sleep) increases with age yet treatment options in older patients are limited. In older patients, because of a risk of side effects, guidelines suggest caution when prescribing sleep medications and, for some drugs, recommend starting at a lower dose. Daridorexant was approved in 2022 for the treatment of insomnia in adults following positive results in two trials that showed daridorexant significantly improved night-time sleep and daytime functioning over 3 months of treatment in adults with insomnia. Approximately 40% of patients taking part in these trials were aged 65 years or older. This current analysis compared the safety and benefits of daridorexant in older adults (aged at least 65 years) and younger adults (aged less than 65 years) in the trial that administered the highest two doses of daridorexant, 25 and 50 mg. The results showed that the benefits of daridorexant were comparable in both age groups over 3 months; compared with placebo, daridorexant improved night-time sleep (reduced time awake during the night, reduced time to fall asleep and increased total sleep time) and daytime functioning—patients had less daytime sleepiness and a better mood and feeling of alertness. In older patients, the benefits, particularly for daytime functioning, were greatest at the higher 50-mg dose, without any increase in side effects. Both doses of daridorexant were equally well tolerated in the two age groups, indicating that treatment with daridorexant at 50 mg can be safely started in older patients.Aged Double-Blind Method Humans Imidazoles Lipopolysaccharides Orexin Receptor Antagonists / adverse effects Pyrrolidines Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders* / drug therapy Sleepiness Treatment Outcome",2022 Oct

To assess the efficacy of this compound in a statistically sufficient number of narcoleptic patients a double-blind, placebo-controlled, European multi-center study on the effects of ritanserin on daytime sleepiness, the feeling of being refreshed in the morning, number of unwanted sleep periods and slow-wave sleep was performed. All 134 narcolepsy patients were allowed to remain on stable concomitant antidepressant, stimulant and gammahydroxybutyrate medication during the trial. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with 5 mg or 10 mg ritanserin or placebo given once daily for 28 days. Efficacy was measured by two 40-hour polysomnographic recordings, visual analogue scales and physician, partner, parents and patient-rated sleep-wake behavior tests prior to and after the trial. Patients kept diaries on sleepiness, numbers of wanted and unwanted sleep periods, feeling of being refreshed and frequency of narcoleptic symptoms during the entire treatment period. Treatment with 5 and 10 mg ritanserin significantly improved the 'feeling of being refreshed in the morning,' but no other narcoleptic symptoms as assessed in the diary. Whereas investigators had the impression that the primary efficacy parameters were not improved by ritanserin, patients reported significant improvements in four out of six parameters, and patients partners in two out of six parameters with 5 mg ritanserin compared to placebo. Both ritanserin doses resulted in a significant increase of nocturnal slow-wave sleep (percentage of total sleep time) and a significant, dose-dependent reduction in NREM stage 1 percentage during daytime sleep. The significant polysomnographic findings were not paralleled by changes in the subjective parameters daytime sleepiness or number of unplanned sleep periods. In contrast to the first study on narcoleptic patients, ritanserin only improved one subjective parameter, but did not improve objective sleep quality or number of ""sleep attacks"" or reduce ""wake after sleep onset"" during night or daytime sleep. In conclusion, ritanserin may serve as add-on medication for the treatment of impaired sleep quality in narcoleptic patients, but not as a stimulant or hypnotic type of medication.Adult Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Double-Blind Method Drug Therapy, Combination Female Humans Male Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Polysomnography Ritanserin / administration & dosage Ritanserin / therapeutic use* Serotonin Antagonists / administration & dosage Serotonin Antagonists / therapeutic use* Sleep / drug effects",2003 Jul

Negative allosteric modulators of GABA-A receptors, including clarithromycin, have been reported to reduce sleepiness in these patients. We sought to systematically assess the effects of clarithromycin on objective vigilance and subjective sleepiness.
This was a 5-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial of clarithromycin 500mg with breakfast and lunch, in patients with hypersomnolence syndromes (excluding narcolepsy with cataplexy) and evidence for abnormal cerebrospinal fluid potentiation of GABA-A receptors. The study occurred at a university-affiliated medical center. The primary outcome measure was median reaction time on the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) at week 2 in each condition. Secondary outcomes included the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Stanford Sleepiness Scale, Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, SF-36, and additional PVT measures.
Twenty-three patients began treatment. Three patients dropped out, and final analyses were performed on 20 complete cases. Median reaction time was not significantly different between clarithromycin and placebo. Subjective measures of sleepiness were significantly improved on clarithromycin versus placebo. Altered taste perception occurred, but was the only side effect more common on clarithromycin than placebo. No serious adverse events occurred.
Subjective sleepiness, but not psychomotor vigilance, improved during a 2-week course of clarithromycin. Although additional studies are needed, this suggests that clarithromycin may be a reasonable treatment option in patients with treatment-refractory hypersomnolence.

We aimed to test the hypothesis that a combination of ondansetron (Ond) and fluoxetine (Fl) may effectively reduce expression of disordered breathing during REM and NREM sleep in patients with OSA.
A prospective, parallel-groups, single-center trial in patients with OSA.
35 adults with apnea hypopnea index (AHI) > 10; range 10-98.

AHI was measured by in-lab polysomnography after a 7-day no-treatment period (Baseline) and on days 14 and 28 of treatment. The primary endpoint was AHI reduction at days 14 and 28. OND+FL resulted in approximately 40% reduction of baseline AHI at days 14 and 28 (unadjusted P < 0.03 for each) and improved oximetry trends.

Although serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been shown to produce modest reductions in the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, they have not been proven to be generally effective as treatments for OSA. Conversely, antagonists of type 3 (5-HT3) serotonin receptors effectively have been shown to reduce the frequency of central apneas during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in a rodent model of sleep-related breathing disorder. We sought to determine whether mirtazapine, a mixed 5-HT2/5-HT3 antagonist that also promotes serotonin release in the brain would effectively reduce AHI during both NREM and REM sleep in patients with OSA.
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-way crossover study of mirtazapine in patients with OSA.
Laboratory studies were conducted in the Center for Sleep and Ventilatory Disorders at the University of Illinois Medical Center.
Seven adult men and 5 adult women with newly diagnosed (treatment-naïve) and medically uncomplicated OSA were randomized into the study.
Each subject self-administered oral medications 30 minutes before bedtime each night for 3 consecutive 7-day treatment periods. These treatments comprised (1) placebo, (2) 4.5 mg per day of mirtazapine, and (3) 15 mg per day of mirtazapine. The order of treatments was randomized for each subject, and orders were counterbalanced for the overall study.
Each subject charted his or her sleep-wake schedule throughout the study and completed the Stanford Sleepiness Scale every 2 hours during the seventh day of each treatment period. Subjects were studied by laboratory polysomnography on the seventh night of each treatment period. With respect to placebo treatment, 4.5 mg of mirtazapine significantly reduced the AHI in all sleep stages to 52%, with 11 of 12 subjects showing improvement over placebo; 15 mg of mirtazapine reduced the AHI to 46%, with 12 of 12 subjects showing improvement over placebo. Sleep fragmentation was reduced only by the higher dose of mirtazapine. Gross changes in sleep architecture were unremarkable.
Daily administration of 4.5 to 15 mg of mirtazapine for 1 week reduces AHI by half in adult patients with OSA. This represents the largest and most consistent drug-treatment effect demonstrated to date in a controlled trial. These findings suggest the therapeutic potential of mixed-profile serotonergic drugs in OSA and provide support for future studies with related formulations. Mirtazapine also is associated with sedation and weight gain-2 negative side effects in patients with OSA. In view of the above, we do not recommend use of mirtazapine as a treatment for OSA.Administration, Oral Adolescent Adult Aged Cross-Over Studies Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Double-Blind Method Female Humans Male Mianserin / analogs & derivatives* Mianserin / therapeutic use Middle Aged Mirtazapine Polysomnography / drug effects Serotonin 5-HT2 Receptor Antagonists Serotonin 5-HT3 Receptor Antagonists Serotonin Antagonists / therapeutic use* Sleep Apnea, Obstructive / drug therapy*",2007 Jan

Major wakefulness-promoting nuclei are the histaminergic tuberomamillary nucleus (TMN) of the hypothalamus and the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) of the pons, which also play a role in autonomic regulation. First generation antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, are likely to cause sedation by blocking excitatory H1 histamine receptors in the cerebral cortex, and the anti-narcolepsy drug modafinil may promote wakefulness by activating the locus coeruleus. We compared the effects of single doses of diphenhydramine (75 mg) and modafinil (200 mg) on arousal and autonomic functions in 16 healthy male volunteers, using a placebo-controlled, balanced, double-blind design. Arousal was assessed by critical flicker fusion frequency (CFFF), visual analogue scales (VAS) and pupillary fatigue waves (Pupillographic Sleepiness Test (PST)). Autonomic functions measured included resting pupil diameter, light and darkness reflex responses, blood pressure, heart rate and salivation. Data were analysed with ANOVA, with multiple comparisons. Diphenhydramine had sedative effects as shown by reductions in CFFF, VAS alertness ratings and increases of the indices of pupillary fatigue. Modafinil had alerting effects as indicated by reductions in the measures of pupillary fatigue. Comparison of pre-post medication changes in pupil diameter showed a decrease after diphenhydramine and an increase after modafinil. Diphenhydramine reduced salivation, and modafinil increased systolic blood pressure. In conclusion, diphenhydramine and modafinil evoked opposite effects on arousal and sympathetic functions, which are likely to reflect their interaction with the central histaminergic and noradrenergic systems. Hyposalivation by diphenhydramine is likely to be due to its additional anticholinergic property.Administration, Oral Adult Affect / drug effects Arousal / drug effects* Attention / drug effects Autonomic Nervous System / drug effects* Benzhydryl Compounds / administration & dosage Benzhydryl Compounds / pharmacology* Blood Pressure / drug effects Central Nervous System Stimulants / administration & dosage Central Nervous System Stimulants / pharmacology* Cross-Over Studies Diphenhydramine / administration & dosage Diphenhydramine / pharmacology* Double-Blind Method Flicker Fusion / drug effects Histamine H1 Antagonists / administration & dosage Histamine H1 Antagonists / pharmacology* Humans Male Modafinil Reference Values Reflex, Pupillary / drug effects Salivation / drug effects",2007 Aug

Prespecified subgroup analyses of data from a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trial of solriamfetol for EDS in narcolepsy evaluated the efficacy and safety of solriamfetol by cataplexy status.
Participants with narcolepsy received solriamfetol (75, 150, or 300 mg/day) or placebo and were stratified by cataplexy status. Coprimary endpoints were change from baseline on Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS); Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) was the key secondary endpoint. Change in frequency of cataplexy attacks was evaluated in participants reporting cataplexy at baseline. Safety was evaluated. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons; therefore p values are nominal.
There were 117 participants in the cataplexy subgroup and 114 in the non-cataplexy subgroup. At week 12, least-squares (LS) mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) differences from placebo on change from baseline in MWT for solriamfetol 75, 150, and 300 mg in the cataplexy subgroup were 1.6 (- 3.6 to 6.9), 6.1 (0.7-11.4), and 8.9 (3.5-14.2) minutes, respectively (p < 0.05; 150 and 300 mg), and in the non-cataplexy subgroup were 3.4 (- 1.9 to 8.7), 9.1 (3.8-14.3), and 11.2 (5.8-16.6) minutes, respectively (p < 0.001; 150 and 300 mg). At week 12, LS mean (95% CI) differences from placebo on ESS change from baseline for solriamfetol 75, 150, and 300 mg in the cataplexy subgroup were - 1.3 (- 3.9 to 1.3), - 3.7 (- 6.4 to - 1.1), and - 4.5 (- 7.1 to - 1.9), respectively (p < 0.01; 150 and 300 mg), and in the non-cataplexy subgroup were - 3.0 (- 5.6 to - 0.4), - 3.7 (- 6.3 to - 1.2), and - 4.9 (- 7.6 to - 2.2), respectively (p < 0.05; all doses). For PGI-C at week 12, the mean percentage difference from placebo (95% CI) for solriamfetol 75, 150, and 300 mg in the cataplexy subgroup was 10% (- 15 to 35), 33% (9-57), and 39% (16-61), respectively (p < 0.05; 150 and 300 mg), and in the non-cataplexy subgroup was 48% (25-70), 44% (21-67), and 52% (30-73), respectively (p < 0.001; all doses), with somewhat differential treatment effects for 75 mg by cataplexy status. No changes in the number of cataplexy attacks were observed for solriamfetol compared with placebo (mean ± standard deviation changes: - 3.6 ± 13.3 [combined solriamfetol] and - 3.5 ± 9.8 [placebo]). Common adverse events (headache, nausea, decreased appetite, and nasopharyngitis) were similar between cataplexy subgroups.
These data strongly indicate that solriamfetol was effective in treating EDS in participants with narcolepsy with or without cataplexy, as indicated by robust effects on MWT, ESS, and PGI-C. The safety profile was similar regardless of cataplexy status.

This analysis evaluated solriamfetol's efficacy in subgroups of participants with OSA who were adherent or nonadherent to primary OSA therapy at baseline and examined whether solriamfetol affected the use of primary therapy in an open-label extension trial.
Participants with OSA who completed prior solriamfetol studies received solriamfetol 75, 150, or 300 mg/day for ≤ 52 weeks. The main efficacy outcome was the Epworth Sleepiness Scale score. Primary therapy use was summarized as the percentage of nights, the number of hours/night, and the percentage of nights with use ≥ 50%/night (%). Efficacy and primary therapy use are reported for participants who directly enrolled from a previous 12-week study and had ≤ 40 weeks of open-label treatment (n = 333). Safety data are reported for all participants (n = 417).
Mean ESS scores in adherent (n = 255) and nonadherent (n = 78) subgroups, respectively, were 15.0 and 15.8 at baseline (of 12-week study) and 6.5 and 6.8 at week 40. For participants using an airway therapy, mean use at baseline was 90% of nights, 6.6 hours/night, and use ≥ 50%/night on 90% of nights; changes from baseline to week 40 were minimal (0.9%, -0.8 hours, and 6.5%, respectively). Common adverse events (both subgroups) included headache, nasopharyngitis, insomnia, dry mouth, nausea, anxiety, and upper respiratory tract infection.
Long-term efficacy and safety of solriamfetol were similar regardless of adherence to primary OSA therapy. Solriamfetol did not affect primary therapy use.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and bioavailability of solriamfetol at the highest intended therapeutic dose in healthy adults and to characterize its renal excretion under fasting conditions.
In this open-label, randomized, crossover study, healthy adult subjects received a single 300-mg dose of solriamfetol in a fasted condition (10 h) and in a fed condition (30 min after the start of a standardized high-fat, high-calorie breakfast), with at least a 7-day washout period between doses. Blood samples for PK analyses were collected during both conditions at prespecified time points. Urine samples were collected up to 48 h postdose in the fasted condition. Samples were analyzed for solriamfetol (plasma and urine) and N-acetyl solriamfetol (urine) by using validated LC-MS/MS bioanalytical methods.

Of 228 enrolled patients, 71 discontinued antidepressant therapy. Data from 57 patients were available for analysis: 37 patients discontinued tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and 20 discontinued selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The trial included a 21-day withdrawal phase followed by 18-day washout and 14-day single-blind treatment phases. Two additional weeks were permitted for withdrawal from fluoxetine due to its long half-life. Weekly cataplexy attacks were recorded throughout the trial. No historical data on the frequency of cataplexy prior to treatment with antidepressants was available.
Among the patients who were and were not withdrawn from antidepressants treatment, the median frequency of baseline weekly cataplexy was similar (17.5 vs. 14.0, respectively). As expected, significant between-group differences emerged by the end of the washout period (52.04 vs. 15.25, respectively; p<0.05); however, the frequency of cataplexy events became similar again by the end of the trial (16.5 vs. 17.5, respectively).
Patients gradually withdrawn from antidepressants experienced a significant increase in cataplexy, but eventually returned to their baseline frequency, comparable to previously untreated control patients.

Undetectable cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels are seen in narcolepsy, which is frequently associated with secondary depression. Shortened rapid eye movement latency is observed in both narcolepsy and depression. Cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels have not been reported in mood disorders.
We examined hypocretin-1 levels in 14 control and 15 depressed subjects. Cerebrospinal fluid was drawn continuously in supine subjects for 24 hours with an indwelling intrathecal catheter under entrained light-dark conditions. Depressed subjects were studied before and after 5 weeks of sertraline (n=10, three nonresponders) or bupropion (n=5, two nonresponders).
Hypocretin-1 levels varied slightly (amplitude 10%) but significantly across the diurnal cycle in control subjects, with amplitude significantly reduced in depression (3%). Levels were lowest at midday, surprising for a hypothetically wake-promoting peptide. Mean hypocretin levels trended higher in depressive than in control subjects. Hypocretin-1 levels decreased modestly but significantly after sertraline (-14%) but not bupropion.
Our results are consistent with previous physiologic findings in depression indicating dampened diurnal variations in hypocretin-1. The finding that sertraline but not bupropion slightly decreased cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 indicates a serotoninergic influence on hypocretin tone.Adult Antidepressive Agents / therapeutic use Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation / therapeutic use Bupropion / therapeutic use Carrier Proteins / cerebrospinal fluid* Carrier Proteins / drug effects Case-Control Studies Circadian Rhythm* / drug effects Depressive Disorder / cerebrospinal fluid* Depressive Disorder / drug therapy* Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors / therapeutic use Female Humans Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins* Male Neuropeptides / cerebrospinal fluid* Neuropeptides / drug effects Orexins Radioimmunoassay Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors / therapeutic use Sertraline / therapeutic use",2003 Jul 15

This analysis distinguishes short (<0.5 s) and long (>0.5 s) muscle activity indices per hour (SMI, LMI) in 116 patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy. While stable stimulant medication was permitted, tricyclics and SSRIs were withdrawn. Polysomnographies were performed at baseline (V5), four weeks after titration of SO to 4.5 g, 6 g, or 9 g or placebo (V6) and after another four weeks on stable SO dose (V7).
SMI and LMI decreased significantly during light sleep. LMI remained stable in all SO groups during slow wave sleep (SWS), but decreased significantly during REM sleep. SMI decreased non-significantly, but consistently during SWS and REM in the 9 g group only. A subgroup analysis of patients who stayed on stimulants showed that they had higher SMIs and LMIs in all groups. Patients who had been treated with anticataplectic medication prior to study inclusion had lower LMIs in the 9 g group during REM sleep in all visits.
SO has a differential effect on muscle tone that is dose and sleep stage dependent. Low dosages increase short muscle activity, possibly enabling the occurrence of parasomnias. High doses are especially efficacious in REM sleep, suggesting that SO could be used to treat REM sleep behavior disorder. Comedication with stimulants and prior medication with anticataplectic medication exerts an influence on muscle tone.Adult Central Nervous System Stimulants / therapeutic use Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Double-Blind Method Female Humans Male Movement / drug effects Movement / physiology Multivariate Analysis Muscle Tonus / drug effects* Muscle, Skeletal / drug effects Muscle, Skeletal / physiopathology Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Narcolepsy / physiopathology Polysomnography Sleep Aids, Pharmaceutical / therapeutic use* Sleep Stages / drug effects Sleep Stages / physiology Sodium Oxybate / therapeutic use*",2017 Jul

Subsequently, participants were randomly assigned to receive 4.5, 6.0, or 9.0 g per day of sodium oxybate or placebo taken in two equally divided doses upon retiring to bed and again 2.5 to 4 hours later for 4 weeks during the stable dosing phase.
The change in quality of life following the administration of sodium oxybate was measured with the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire. The nightly administration of sodium oxybate produced significant dose-related improvements in the Total Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire score, as well as in the Activity Level, General Productivity, Vigilance, and Social Outcomes subscales.
The nocturnal administration of sodium oxybate in patients with narcolepsy was associated with statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in functional status, an important component of quality of life.Adjuvants, Anesthesia / therapeutic use* Adult Disorders of Excessive Somnolence / diagnosis Disorders of Excessive Somnolence / epidemiology Double-Blind Method Drug Administration Schedule Female Humans Male Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Polysomnography Quality of Life / psychology* Sodium Oxybate / therapeutic use* Surveys and Questionnaires Treatment Outcome",2006 Sep

Patients were adults with narcolepsy who had baseline scores ≥ 10 on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and baseline sleep latency ≤ 10 min on the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT). Patients received a daily placebo (n = 49) or JZP-110 (n = 44) 150 mg/day weeks 1-4 and 300 mg/day weeks 5-12. Primary efficacy endpoints were change from baseline in average MWT sleep latency, and the Clinical Global Impression-Change (CGI-C); secondary endpoints were change from baseline in ESS score and Patient Global Impression-Change.
Improvements were significantly greater with JZP-110 versus placebo on mean MWT sleep latency (4 w, 9.5 versus 1.4 min, P < 0.0001; 12 w, 12.8 versus 2.1 min, P < 0.0001), percentage of patients with CGI-C improvement (4 w, 80% versus 51%, P = 0.0066; 12 w, 86% versus 38%, P < 0.0001), and mean change in ESS (4 w, -5.6 versus -2.4, P = 0.0038; 12 w, -8.5 versus -2.5, P < 0.0001). Three JZP-110-treated patients (6.8%) discontinued due to adverse events (AEs). The most common AEs with JZP-110 versus placebo were insomnia (23% versus 8%), headache (16% versus 10%), nausea (14% versus 6%), diarrhea (11% versus 6%), decreased appetite (14% versus 0%), and anxiety (11% versus 0%).
At doses of 150-300 mg/day, JZP-110 was well tolerated and significantly improved the ability to stay awake and subjective symptoms of excessive sleepiness in adults with narcolepsy.

LXB was shown to improve cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness in people with narcolepsy in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized withdrawal study (NCT03030599). Additional analyses of data from this study were conducted to explore the effects of LXB on cataplexy, including the clinical course and feasibility of transition from other anticataplectics to LXB monotherapy.
The aim of these analyses was to evaluate cataplexy frequency during initiation/optimization of LXB and taper/discontinuation of prior antidepressant/anticataplectic medications.
Eligible participants (adults aged 18-70 years with narcolepsy with cataplexy) entered the study taking SXB only (group A), SXB + other anticataplectics (group B), or anticataplectic medication other than SXB (group C), or were cataplexy-treatment naive (group D). LXB was initiated/optimized during a 12-week, open-label, optimized treatment and titration period (OLOTTP). Other anticataplectics were tapered/discontinued during weeks 3-10 of OLOTTP. A 2-week stable-dose period (SDP; during which participants took a stable dose of open-label LXB) and 2-week double-blind randomized withdrawal period (during which participants were randomized to continue LXB treatment or switch to placebo) followed OLOTTP. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were recorded throughout the duration of the study.
At the beginning of OLOTTP, median weekly cataplexy attacks were lower in participants taking SXB at study entry (SXB only [2.00]; SXB + other anticataplectics [0.58]) versus participants who were taking other anticataplectics (3.50) or were anticataplectic naive (5.83). Median weekly cataplexy attacks decreased during weeks 1-2 of OLOTTP in all groups. Increased cataplexy frequency was observed in participants tapering/discontinuing other anticataplectics during weeks 3-10 and was more prominent in participants taking other anticataplectics alone compared with those taking SXB plus other anticataplectics. Cataplexy frequency decreased throughout initiation/optimization in anticataplectic-naive participants. Median number of cataplexy-free days/week at the end of SDP (study week 14) was similar in all groups (6.0, 6.1, 6.0, and 6.2 in groups A, B, C, and D, respectively). During OLOTTP and SDP, TEAEs of worsening cataplexy were reported in 0%, 47.8%, 16.7%, and 2.2% of participants in groups A, B, C, and D, respectively; most TEAEs of worsening cataplexy were reported during tapering/discontinuation of other anticataplectics.
LXB monotherapy was effective in reducing cataplexy and increasing cataplexy-free days. These results illustrate the feasibility of switching from SXB to LXB while tapering/discontinuing other anticataplectics.
A Study of the Efficacy and Safety of JZP-258 in Subjects With Narcolepsy With Cataplexy; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03030599 ; clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03030599.
People with narcolepsy are often sleepy during the day. They may also have sudden muscle weakness (known as cataplexy). Lower-sodium oxybate (LXB) is a narcolepsy medicine that is similar to sodium oxybate (SXB) but has 92% less sodium. A recent study found that treatment with LXB was better at reducing how often people with narcolepsy had sleepiness and cataplexy than no medicine at all (NCT03030599). This paper is about the first 12 weeks of that study, when all the people taking part in the study first tried LXB to check that they were being given the right amount. In people who only took LXB, cataplexy happened less often over time. Some people were already taking other medicines to treat their cataplexy (such as antidepressants), so they were asked to slowly stop those medicines while taking LXB. In those people, cataplexy happened more often at first as they stopped taking antidepressants and then less often later on. The increase in cataplexy when antidepressants were stopped was smaller in people who switched from SXB to LXB. This study shows that many people getting treatment for narcolepsy can switch to LXB without their cataplexy becoming worse.Adult Cataplexy* / drug therapy Disorders of Excessive Somnolence* / drug therapy Double-Blind Method Humans Narcolepsy* / chemically induced Narcolepsy* / drug therapy Sodium Oxybate* / adverse effects",2022 Jun

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of modafinil on cognitive and thymopsychic variables in patients with narcolepsy and investigate whether neurophysiological vigilance changes correlate with cognitive and subjective vigilance alterations at the behavioral level. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, EEG-LORETA and psychometric data were obtained during midmorning hours in 15 narcoleptics before and after 3 weeks of placebo or 400 mg modafinil. Cognitive investigations included the Pauli Test and complex reaction time. Thymopsychic/psychophysiological evaluation comprised drive, mood, affectivity, wakefulness, depression, anxiety, the Symptom Checklist 90 and critical flicker frequency. The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) were performed too. Cognitive performance (Pauli Test) was significantly better after modafinil than after placebo. Concerning reaction time and thymopsychic variables, no significant differences were observed. Correlation analyses revealed that a decrease in prefrontal delta, theta and alpha-1 power correlated with an improvement in cognitive performance. Moreover, drowsiness was positively correlated with theta power in parietal and medial prefrontal regions and beta-1 and beta-2 power in occipital regions. A less significant correlation was observed between midmorning EEG LORETA and the MSLT; between EEG LORETA and the ESS, the correlation was even weaker. In conclusion, modafinil did not influence thymopsychic variables in narcolepsy, but it significantly improved cognitive performance, which may be related to medial prefrontal activity processes identified by LORETA.Adult Affect / drug effects Arousal / drug effects Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use* Brain Mapping Central Nervous System Stimulants / therapeutic use* Cognition / drug effects Cross-Over Studies Double-Blind Method Drive Electroencephalography / drug effects* Female Fourier Analysis Humans Image Processing, Computer-Assisted* Imaging, Three-Dimensional* Magnetic Resonance Imaging* Male Middle Aged Modafinil Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Neuropsychological Tests Occipital Lobe / drug effects Polysomnography Prefrontal Cortex / drug effects Reaction Time / drug effects Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted Software Wakefulness / drug effects",2007 Jan 15

Thirty-nine drug-naïve patients with Narcolepsy Type 1, twenty-four drug-naïve patients with Idiopathic Hypersomnia, and thirty age- and sex- matched healthy controls underwent seven days of actigraphic and self-report monitoring of sleep/wake behavior. The following variables were examined: estimated time in bed (eTIB), estimated total sleep time, estimated sleep latency (eSOL), estimated sleep efficiency, estimated wake after sleep onset, number of estimated awakenings (eAwk), number of estimated awakenings longer than 5 minutes, estimated sleep motor activity (eSMA), number of estimated naps, mean duration of the longest estimated nap (eNapD), and daytime motor activity.
All actigraphic parameters significantly differentiated the three groups, except eTIB and eSOL.

Actigraphy has been validated in people with sleep disturbances; however, the validity of scoring settings in people with chronic medical illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease remains unclear. The purpose of this secondary analysis was to compare actigraphy-customized scoring settings with polysomnography (PSG) for the measurement of sleep outcomes in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who have insomnia.
Participants underwent overnight sleep assessment simultaneously by PSG and actigraphy at the University of Illinois of Chicago Sleep Science Center. Fifty participants (35 men and 15 women) with mild-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and co-existing insomnia were included in the analysis. Sleep onset latency, total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep efficiency (SE) were calculated independently from data derived from PSG and actigraphy. Actigraphy sleep outcome scores obtained at the default setting and several customized actigraphy settings were compared to the scored PSG results.
Although no single setting was optimal for all sleep outcomes, the combination of 10 consecutive immobile minutes for sleep onset or end and an activity threshold of 10 worked well. Actigraphy overestimated TST and SE and underestimated WASO, but there was no difference in variance between PSG and actigraphy in TST and SE when the 10 × 10 combination was used. As the average TST and SE increased, the agreement between PSG and actigraphy appeared to increase, and as the average WASO decreased, the agreement between PSG and actigraphy appeared to increase.
Results support the conclusion that the default actigraphy settings may not be optimal for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and co-existing insomnia.Actigraphy* / methods Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Female Humans Male Middle Aged Outcome Assessment, Health Care / methods* Polysomnography Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive / complications* Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive / physiopathology Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive / therapy Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders / complications* Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders / physiopathology Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders / therapy* Sleep* / physiology",2017 Sep

However, it was reported to induce emotional instability, including mania, depression, and suicidal ideation. Such side effects may be related to changes in cognitive behavior caused by the effects of modafinil on emotional recognition. However, the effects of modafinil on the neural basis of emotional processing have not been fully verified. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the effects of modafinil on the neural basis of auditory emotional processing.
This study adopted a placebo-controlled within-subject crossover design. Data from 14 participants were analyzed. The effects of modafinil on cerebral activation and task performance during an emotional judgement task were analyzed.
Task accuracy decreased significantly and response time of emotional judgement was significantly delayed by modafinil, as compared with placebo. Right thalamic activation in auditory emotional processing was significantly less in the modafinil condition than in the placebo condition. In addition, reduction of right thalamic activation by modafinil was positively correlated with accuracy of emotional judgement.
Our findings suggest that modafinil acts on the right thalamus and changes behavior and brain function associated with auditory emotional processing. These results indicate that modafinil might change emotional recognition by reducing emotional activation related to social communication.Affect / drug effects* Central Nervous System Stimulants / therapeutic use* Cross-Over Studies Emotions / physiology* Evoked Potentials, Auditory Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging Modafinil / therapeutic use* Thalamus / diagnostic imaging Thalamus / drug effects*",2021 Nov 17

TMS measures were correlated with the conventional neurophysiological method of Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and the subjective Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS).
As previously reported, motor threshold and SICI were significantly increased in patients with narcolepsy; modafinil reversed this cortical hypoexcitability, but only SICI differences reached statistical significance. The Spearman rank correlation analysis revealed the highest correlation between SICI and the MSLT; a positive correlation was also found between SICI and the ESS, as well as between RMT and both measures of daytime sleepiness.
This represents the first report investigating effects of modafinil on cortical excitability in human narcolepsy. Since SICI is thought to be directly related to GABA(A) intracortical inhibitory activity, we demonstrated that the dose of modafinil that induces a satisfactory wakefulness-promoting response in narcoleptic patients also causes decrease in GABAergic transmission.Adult Benzhydryl Compounds / pharmacology Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use* Central Nervous System Stimulants / pharmacology Central Nervous System Stimulants / therapeutic use* Double-Blind Method Evoked Potentials, Motor / drug effects Evoked Potentials, Motor / physiology Female Humans Male Middle Aged Modafinil Motor Cortex / drug effects* Motor Cortex / physiopathology Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Narcolepsy / physiopathology Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation* Young Adult",2010 Oct

In a previous study, we have reported that single dose administration of modafinil in healthy young subjects enhances fluid reasoning and affects resting state activity in the Fronto Parietal Control (FPC) and Dorsal Attention (DAN) networks. No changes were found in the Salience Network (SN), a surprising result as the network is involved in the modulation of emotional and fluid reasoning. The insula is crucial hub of the SN and functionally divided in anterior and posterior subregions.
Using a seed-based approach, we have now analyzed effects of modafinil on the functional connectivity (FC) of insular subregions.
Analysis of FC with resting state fMRI (rs-FMRI) revealed increased FC between the right posterior insula and the putamen, the superior frontal gyrus and the anterior cingulate cortex in the modafinil-treated group.
Modafinil is considered a putative cognitive enhancer. The rs-fMRI modifications that we have found are consistent with the drug cognitive enhancing properties and indicate subregional targets of action.

The neurochemical substrates and mechanisms of armodafinil are unresolved. We investigated the hypothesis that armodafinil enhances wakefulness by modulating the activities of the dopamine transporter (DAT). With positron emission tomography imaging, we determined DAT occupancy and changes in extracellular dopamine by armodafinil in vivo.
Twelve subjects were enrolled. Plasma armodafinil levels were obtained. In vivo armodafinil occupancy of the DAT in striatum was detected by [¹¹C]altropane and changes in extracellular dopamine were detected by indirect displacement of [¹¹C]raclopride in human subjects at different times after drug administration.
Armodafinil (100 mg by mouth [PO]) occupied striatal DAT (34.0 ± 9.0% at 1 hour, 40.4 ± 9.5% at 2.5 hours, n = 6) and 250 mg occupied striatal DAT (60.5 ± 7.4% at 1 hour, 65.2 ± 6.1% at 2.5 hours, n = 6). In addition, armodafinil was associated with changes in extracellular dopamine (17.8 ± 30.1% [100 mg PO] and 7.0 ± 8.6% [250 mg PO] at 2.5 hours, n = 6).
Occupancy of the DAT and changes in extracellular dopamine in vivo further implicates the actions of armodafinil on DAT as a potential candidate for its therapeutic improvement of wakefulness and other conditions.Adolescent Adult Benzhydryl Compounds / blood Benzhydryl Compounds / pharmacology* Carbon Radioisotopes Central Nervous System Stimulants / blood Central Nervous System Stimulants / pharmacology* Cocaine / analogs & derivatives* Corpus Striatum / diagnostic imaging Corpus Striatum / drug effects Corpus Striatum / metabolism Dopamine / metabolism* Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins / metabolism* Female Humans Male Middle Aged Modafinil Positron-Emission Tomography / methods* Raclopride* Radioligand Assay / methods*",2010 Nov 15

The home diary method was found to be a viable model for the assessment of anticataplectic activity. Assessment of reliability in 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5- and 10-day intervals indicated that reliability increases with the number of days included. A 10-day design was found to be optimal. Reliability decreased, however, with each successive diary over the 4-month period. Power analysis indicates that two groups of 30-40 subjects in a parallel design, or one group of 30-40 subjects in a crossover design, would be sufficient to demonstrate a significant therapeutic anticataplectic effect in most cases. A ""first diary effect"" was observed, suggesting that a training period prior to the actual trial might improve reliability. Whether the patient was treated or untreated with stimulant medications did not affect severity or fluctuation of cataplexy, suggesting that both groups of patients could be included in therapeutic trials. No time-of-day fluctuation was observed in the daily distribution of cataplexy attacks. Sudden increases in cataplexy were often, although not always, caused by unusual emotional events or sleepiness. The finding of a long-lasting ""precataplectic"" feeling or ""aura"" pointed to the need to carefully clarify the symptom prior to beginning a therapeutic trial.Catalepsy / diagnosis* Catalepsy / drug therapy Cross-Sectional Studies Double-Blind Method Female Humans Male Middle Aged Placebos Reproducibility of Results Self-Assessment Sleep, REM Surveys and Questionnaires Time Factors",1994 Apr

Little is known about differences in the acute effects of equally cardiostimulant doses of these stimulant-type substances compared directly within the same subjects.
We investigated the acute autonomic, subjective, endocrine, and emotional effects of single doses of MDMA (125 mg), methylphenidate (60 mg), modafinil (600 mg), and placebo in a double-blind, cross-over study in 24 healthy participants. Acute drug effects were tested using psychometric scales, the Facial Emotion Recognition Task (FERT), and the Sexual Arousal and Desire Inventory (SADI).
All active drugs produced comparable hemodynamic and adverse effects. MDMA produced greater increases in pupil dilation, subjective good drug effects, drug liking, happiness, trust, well-being, and alterations in consciousness than methylphenidate or modafinil. Only MDMA reduced subjective anxiety and impaired fear recognition and led to misclassifications of emotions as happy on the FERT. On the SADI, only MDMA produced sexual arousal-like effects. Only MDMA produced marked increases in cortisol, prolactin, and oxytocin. In contrast to MDMA, methylphenidate increased subjective anxiety, and methylphenidate and modafinil increased misclassifications of emotions as angry on the FERT. Modafinil had no significant subjective drug effects but significant sympathomimetic and adverse effects.
MDMA induced subjective, emotional, sexual, and endocrine effects that were clearly distinct from those of methylphenidate and modafinil at the doses used.Adult Arousal / drug effects* Arousal / physiology Autonomic Nervous System / drug effects Autonomic Nervous System / physiology Central Nervous System Stimulants / pharmacology Cross-Over Studies Double-Blind Method Emotions / drug effects* Emotions / physiology Facial Recognition / drug effects* Facial Recognition / physiology Female Hallucinogens / pharmacology Healthy Volunteers Humans Libido / drug effects Libido / physiology Male Methylphenidate / pharmacology* Modafinil / pharmacology* N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine / pharmacology* Sexual Behavior / drug effects Sexual Behavior / physiology Sexual Behavior / psychology Young Adult",2018 Feb

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has proved effective not only in people with primary insomnia but also in people with insomnia comorbid with psychiatric and medical illness (eg, depression, cancer, and chronic pain). However, CBT-I has rarely been tested in those with COPD who have disease-related features that interfere with sleep and may lessen the effectiveness of such therapies. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of applying a CBT-I intervention for people with COPD and to assess the impact of CBT-I on insomnia severity and sleep-related outcomes, fatigue, mood, and daytime functioning.

Modafinil (M) is a psychostimulant developed to treat narcolepsy, with ""arousal"" properties attributed to an increased release of dopamine in the CNS. Because other stimulants with similar properties have ergogenic effects, it was hypothesized that acute treatment with M would enhance physical performance.
Fifteen healthy male subjects, with a maximal aerobic power (VO2max) of 47 +/- SD 8 mL x kg x min, exercised on a cycle ergometer for 5 min at 50% VO2max and then at approximately 85% VO2max to exhaustion. They did this weekly for 3 wk: a control trial (C) the first week, and then 3 h after ingesting either placebo (P) or M (4 mg x kg) during the remaining 2 wk. The P and M trials were conducted with a balanced order, double-blind design.
: Mean +/- SD times to exhaustion at 85% VO2max (TE) were 14.3 +/- 2.8, 15.6 +/- 3.8 and 18.3 +/- 3.5 min for the C, P, and M trials, respectively. TE for M was significantly longer than for the C and P trials. Oxygen uptake at exhaustion was slightly but significantly greater for M compared with P and C. HR increased with time and was further elevated by M. Subjective ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were significantly lower for M compared with C and P but only after 10 min of exercise at 85% VO2max.
Acute ingestion of modafinil prolonged exercise time to exhaustion at 85% VO2max and reduced RPE. The RPE results suggest that the dampening of the sensation of fatigue was likely a factor responsible for the enhanced performance.Adult Benzhydryl Compounds / administration & dosage* Central Nervous System Stimulants / administration & dosage* Exercise* Humans Male Modafinil Ontario Physical Exertion*",2004 Jun

Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder characterized by disruption of hypocretin neurotransmission. Pituitary LH secretion is diminished in hypocretin-deficient animal models, and intracerebroventricular administration of hypocretin-1 activates the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis in rats. We evaluated whether hypocretin deficiency affects gonadotropin release in humans. To this end, we deconvolved 24-h serum concentrations of LH and FSH in seven hypocretin-deficient narcoleptic males (N) and seven controls (C) matched for age, body mass index, and sex. Basal plasma concentrations of testosterone, estradiol, and sex hormone-binding globulin were similar in both groups. Mean 24-h LH concentration was significantly lower in narcolepsy patients [3.0 +/- 0.4 (N) vs. 4.2 +/- 0.3 (C) U/l, P = 0.01], which was primarily due to a reduction of pulsatile LH secretion [23.5 +/- 1.6 (N) vs. 34.3 +/- 4.9 (C) U.l(-1).24 h(-1), P = 0.02]. The orderliness of LH and FSH secretion, quantitated by the approximate entropy statistic, was greater in patients than in controls. In contrast, all other features of FSH release were similar in narcoleptic and control groups. Also, LH and FSH secretions in response to intravenous administration of 100 microg of GnRH were similar in patients and controls. These data indicate that endogenous hypocretins are involved in the regulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis activity in humans. In particular, reduced LH release in the face of normal pituitary responsivity to GnRH stimulation in narcoleptic men suggests that hypocretins promote endogenous GnRH secretion.Adult Carrier Proteins Entropy Fluorescent Antibody Technique Follicle Stimulating Hormone / metabolism* Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Humans Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins* Leptin / blood Luteinizing Hormone / metabolism* Male Middle Aged Narcolepsy / metabolism* Neuropeptides / deficiency* Orexins Radioimmunoassay Testosterone / blood",2004 Oct

In both normal and narcoleptic subjects, mean cortical activation levels during the presentation of periodic visual and auditory stimulation showed no appreciable differences with either age or sex. Normal subjects showed higher levels of visual activation at 10:00 hours than 15:00 hours, with a reverse pattern in narcoleptic subjects (P = 0.007).

Modafinil caused an increase in self-reported levels of alertness in 7 of 8 narcoleptic subjects, but there was no significant difference between mean pretreatment and post-treatment activation levels as determined by fMRI for either normal or narcoleptic syndrome subjects given modafinil. However, in the modafinil-treated group of 8 normal and 8 narcoleptic subjects, there was a clock time independent correlation between the initial level of activation as determined by the pretreatment scan and the post-treatment change in activation (visual, P = 0.002; and auditory, P = 0.001). No correlation was observed in placebo-treated subjects (P = 0.99 and 0.77, respectively).

Quality of Life Questionnaires (Short Form 36 and Quality of Life in Depression Scale) were also administered. Venlafaxine significantly (p < 0.05) raised CFF scores compared to baseline but had no effect on any other measure. Dothiepin significantly (p < 0.05) lowered CFF threshold, and increased ratings of both sedation and difficulty in waking. The results showed that venlafaxine at doses of 37.5 mg b.i.d. in elderly depressed patients is free from disruptive effects on cognitive function and psychomotor performance.Aged Cognition / drug effects* Cognition / physiology Cyclohexanols / administration & dosage Cyclohexanols / adverse effects Cyclohexanols / therapeutic use* Depressive Disorder / diagnosis Depressive Disorder / drug therapy* Disorders of Excessive Somnolence / chemically induced Dizziness / chemically induced Dizziness / etiology Dothiepin / administration & dosage Dothiepin / adverse effects Dothiepin / therapeutic use* Double-Blind Method Drug Administration Schedule Female Flicker Fusion / drug effects Humans Male Narcolepsy / chemically induced Narcolepsy / etiology Nausea / chemically induced Nausea / etiology Psychometrics / methods Psychomotor Performance / drug effects* Psychomotor Performance / physiology Time Factors Venlafaxine Hydrochloride",2004 Jun

Subjects were drug-free for 2 weeks prior to beginning the protocol. Methamphetamine was the only drug taken during the protocol and was given in a single morning dose of 0, 20 or 40-60 mg to narcoleptics and 0, 5 or 10 mg to controls. The protocol was 28 days long, with each of the four treatment conditions lasting 4 days followed by 3 days of washout. Nighttime polysomnography and daytime testing were done during the last 24 hours of each treatment condition. Daytime sleep tendency was assessed with the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). Daytime performance was assessed with performance tests including a simple, computer-based driving task. Narcoleptics' mean MSLT sleep latency increased from 4.3 minutes on placebo to 9.3 minutes on high dose, compared with an increase from 10.4 to 17.1 minutes for controls. Narcoleptics' error rate on the driving task decreased from 2.53% on placebo to 0.33% on high dose, compared with a decrease from 0.22% to 0.16% for controls. The effects of methamphetamine on nocturnal sleep were generally dose-dependent and affected sleep continuity and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Elimination half life was estimated to be between 15.9 and 22.0 hours. Mild side effects emerged in a dose-dependent fashion and most often involved the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. We concluded that methamphetamine caused a dose-dependent decrease in daytime sleep tendency and improvement in performance in both narcoleptics and controls. Methamphetamine at doses of 40-60 mg allowed narcoleptics to function at levels comparable to those of unmedicated controls.Adult Brain / drug effects Cross-Sectional Studies Delusions / chemically induced Double-Blind Method Female Heart Rate / drug effects Humans Hypertension / chemically induced Male Methamphetamine / adverse effects Methamphetamine / pharmacology Methamphetamine / therapeutic use* Narcolepsy / diagnosis Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Polysomnography Sleep, REM / drug effects Task Performance and Analysis",1993 Jun

Its short half-life and immediate-release formulation require patients to awaken 2.5-4 h after their bedtime dose to take a second dose. A novel extended-release, once-nightly sodium oxybate formulation (ON-SXB; FT218) is under US Food and Drug Administration review for the treatment of adults with narcolepsy.
A phase III trial of ON-SXB in individuals with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) or 2 (NT2) [the REST-ON trial; NCT02720744] has been conducted and the primary results reported elsewhere. Secondary objectives from REST-ON were to assess the efficacy of ON-SXB on disrupted nighttime sleep; the results of this analysis are reported here.
In the double-blind, phase III REST-ON trial, patients aged ≥ 16 years were randomly assigned 1:1 to ON-SXB (1 week, 4.5 g; 2 weeks, 6 g; 5 weeks, 7.5 g; 5 weeks, 9 g) or placebo. Secondary endpoints included polysomnographic measures of sleep stage shifts and nocturnal arousals and patient-reported assessments of sleep quality and refreshing nature of sleep at 6, 7.5, and 9 g; post hoc analyses included changes in time spent in each sleep stage, delta power, and assessments in stimulant-use subgroups for prespecified endpoints.
In total, 190 participants (n = 97, ON-SXB; n = 93, placebo) were included in the efficacy analyses. All three ON-SXB doses demonstrated a clinically meaningful, statistically significant decrease vs placebo in the number of transitions to wake/N1 from N1, N2, and rapid eye movement (REM) stages (all doses p < 0.001) and the number of nocturnal arousals (p < 0.05 ON-SXB 6 g; p < 0.001 7.5 and 9 g). Sleep quality and refreshing nature of sleep were significantly improved with all three ON-SXB doses vs placebo (p < 0.001). Post hoc analyses revealed a significant reduction in time spent in N1 (p < 0.05 ON-SXB 6 g; p < 0.001 7.5 and 9 g) and REM (all p < 0.001) and increased time spent in N3 with ON-SXB vs placebo (all p < 0.001), with a significant increase in delta power (p < 0.01 ON-SXB 6 g; p < 0.05 7.5 g; p < 0.001 9 g) and increased REM latency (ON-SXB 7.5 g vs placebo; p < 0.05). Significant improvements in disrupted nighttime sleep were observed regardless of concomitant stimulant use.
The clinically beneficial, single nighttime dose of ON-SXB significantly improved disrupted nighttime sleep in patients with narcolepsy.

In this double-blind, randomized, crossover study, patients and controls received a single dose of 400mg modafinil or placebo. Modafinil and placebo administrations were separated by a 2-week washout period. TMS parameters, such as resting motor thresholds (RMT), motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes, cortical silent periods (CSP), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF), were measured before and 3h after administering modafinil or placebo. The differences of TMS parameters were statistically tested between patients and controls and between before and after modafinil or placebo administration.
Narcolepsy patients had significantly increased CSP durations compared to controls (independent t-test, P<0.05), indicating decreased excitability of cortical networks in human narcolepsy. In patients after modafinil administration, MEP amplitudes, SICI, and ICF increased, and CSP duration shortened significantly, meaning enhanced motor excitability, whereas in controls modafinil did not change TMS parameters significantly. Placebo administration did not affect TMS parameters both in patients or controls.

The drug was administered orally in a single opaque capsule containing 200 mg caffeine/placebo daily in the morning for 1 week. Sleepiness was assessed objectively using infrared reflectance oculography to measure the percentage of long eye closure (LEC%) and subjectively using two sleepiness scales, the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) and Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). Parameters were measured at baseline (BL) prior to taking the drug, after taking the first dose (FD), and after 1 week (WD) of daily caffeine.
Sixteen participants with narcolepsy were included. No significant differences between groups in baseline measurements were observed. LEC% was significantly decreased after the FD and WD compared with baseline levels (BL 1.4 ± 2.1 vs. FD 0.06 ± 0.0.6 and WD 0.03 ± 0.04). Significant improvements in alertness were observed using the KSS when comparing BL with FD and WD (6.3 ± 1.6, 4.9 ± 1.7, and 4.7 ± 1.7, respectively; p = 0.01). No changes in reaction time or SSS scores were noted.
Our findings suggest that a small dose of caffeine has positive effects on alertness in patients with narcolepsy. However, larger trials are required to confirm these findings.

The addition of two-15 minute naps did not alter either symptom severity or the duration of unscheduled daytime sleep. Regular times for nocturnal sleep reduced perceived symptom severity, but did not reduce the amount of unscheduled daytime sleep. Only the combination of scheduled naps and regular nocturnal sleep times, significantly reduced both symptom severity and the amount of unscheduled daytime sleep in treated narcoleptic subjects. The type of sleep schedule prescribed, however, was less important than the severity of the patients' pre-treatment daytime sleepiness. Subjects with severe daytime sleepiness benefited from the addition of scheduled sleep periods, while those who were only moderately sleepy or able to maintain alertness did not benefit from scheduled sleep periods.
Scheduled sleep periods are helpful for only those patients who remain profoundly sleepy despite stimulant medications and should not be prescribed for all patients with narcolepsy.Adult Circadian Rhythm / physiology* Disorders of Excessive Somnolence / complications Disorders of Excessive Somnolence / prevention & control* Female Humans Male Narcolepsy / complications Narcolepsy / prevention & control* Polysomnography Sleep / physiology* Surveys and Questionnaires",2001 Jun 15

At the final visit, 80% (95% CI: 74.1, 86.7) of patients with treated OSA and 84% (72.7, 94.8) of patients with narcolepsy were rated on the CGI-I as at least minimally improved with regard to overall clinical condition; 98% (95.2, 100.0) of patients with SWD were rated as improved with regard to sleepiness during night shifts, including the commute to and from work. Armodafinil improved ESS total scores in patients with treated OSA (mean [SD] [95% CI] change from baseline, -7.3 [5.6] [-8.39, -6.30]) and patients with narcolepsy (-4.7 [6.0] [-7.41, -1.93]).
Armodafinil administered for 12 months or more was generally well tolerated and improved wakefulness in patients with excessive sleepiness associated with treated OSA, SWD, or narcolepsy.

Forty-four sites in the United States, Canada, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
Two hundred seventy- adult patients with narcolepsy taking 200 to 600 mg of modafinil daily for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness.
Patients received unchanged doses of modafinil (with sodium-oxybate placebo) during a 2-week baseline phase. Following a baseline polysomnogram and Maintenance of Wakefulness Test, they were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups: sodium-oxybate placebo plus modafinil placebo, sodium oxybate plus modafinil placebo, modafinil plus sodium-oxybate placebo, or sodium oxybate plus modafinil. Sodium oxybate was administered as 6 g nightly for 4 weeks and was then increased to 9 g nightly for 4 additional weeks. The primary efficacy measure was the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test; secondary measures included the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, diary recordings, and the Clinical Global Impression-change scale.
Following the switch from modafinil to placebo, the mean average daytime sleep latency on the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test decreased from 9.74 minutes at baseline to 6.87 minutes after 8 weeks (p < .001). In the sodium-oxybate group, there was no decrease in sleep latency, suggesting that this drug was as efficacious in treating the excessive daytime sleepiness as the previously administered modafinil. In contrast, the sodium-oxybate/modafinil group demonstrated an increase in daytime sleep latency from 10.43 minutes to 13.15 minutes (p < .001), suggesting that this combination of drugs produced an additive effect. The sodium-oxybate group also demonstrated a decrease in median average Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores, from 15 to 12.0, whereas the sodium-oxybate/modafinil group decreased from 15.0 to 11.0 (for both, p < .001). The Clinical Global Impression-Change scale demonstrated similar results.
Sodium oxybate and modafinil are both effective for treating excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy, producing additive effects when used together.

The purpose of this study was to compare the objective Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and the subjective Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) for evaluating the efficacy of modafinil in treating excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy in Taiwan. Ten consecutive patients with narcolepsy-with-cataplexy who were treated with 200 mg/day modafinil for more than 6 months at our sleep center between January 2003 and December 2007 were included in this study. This comparative study was prompted by the requirement of the Bureau of National Health Insurance in Taiwan that modafinil users need to be followed up with MSLTs every 6-12 months. The mean age at onset of narcolepsy onset in these 10 patients was 11.8 +/- 3.3 years, and eight (80%) were male. We compared the differences in MSLT and ESS between baseline and follow-up at 6-12 months after starting modafinil therapy using paired t tests. ESS scores (p < 0.001) were considerably more sensitive than MSLT scores (p < 0.05) in documenting efficacy of modafinil and that the improvements in MSLT scores were minimal and remained in the pathologically sleepy range. These findings suggest that the ESS is a more sensitive and clinically meaningful tool to evaluate the efficacy of modafinil in narcolepsy.Adolescent Benzhydryl Compounds / administration & dosage* Child Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Male Modafinil Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Narcolepsy / physiopathology Polysomnography Sleep Stages Taiwan Young Adult",2010 Aug

Data of adult patients with narcolepsy from a double-blind, 12-week placebo-controlled study of JZP-110, a wake-promoting agent, were used in this analysis. Descriptive statistics and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis compared PGI-C (anchor measure) to percent change from baseline in ESS to establish the responder criterion from patients taking either placebo or JZP-110 (treatments).
At week 12, patients (n = 10) who reported being ""very much improved"" on the PGI-C had a mean 76.7% reduction in ESS score, and patients (n = 33) who reported being ""much improved"" on the PGI-C had a mean 49.1% reduction in ESS score. ROC analysis showed that patients who improved were almost exclusively from JZP-110 treatment group, with an area-under-the-curve of 0.9, and revealed that a 25% reduction in ESS (sensitivity, 81.4%; specificity, 80.9%) may be an appropriate threshold for defining a meaningful patient response to JZP-110 and placebo.

Of 743 enrolled patients (474 with treated OSA, 113 with SWD, and 156 with narcolepsy), 57% of patients (420/743) completed 12 months or more of treatment. Discontinuations due to adverse events occurred in 13% of patients (95/743) during the initial 12-month period. Throughout the > or = 12-month study, adverse events were generally of mild-to-moderate intensity; headache (25% [180/731]), nasopharyngitis (17% [123/731]), and insomnia (14% [99/731]) were the most common. Modest increases were observed in vital sign measurements (blood pressure [3.6/2.3 mm Hg], heart rate [6.7 beats per minute]) across all patient groups; most of the changes occurred by month 3. Improvements from baseline in efficacy assessments started at month 1 and were maintained throughout the study.
Armodafinil remained effective and was generally well tolerated. Increased monitoring of blood pressure may be appropriate in patients on armodafinil. Armodafinil represents an option for long-term treatment of patients with ES associated with treated OSA, SWD, or narcolepsy.Adult Benzhydryl Compounds / adverse effects Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use* Blood Pressure / drug effects Central Nervous System Stimulants / adverse effects Central Nervous System Stimulants / therapeutic use* Double-Blind Method Female Follow-Up Studies Headache / chemically induced Humans Male Middle Aged Modafinil Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Nasopharyngitis / chemically induced Sleep Apnea, Obstructive / drug therapy* Sleep Disorders, Circadian Rhythm / drug therapy* Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders / chemically induced Time Treatment Outcome Wakefulness / drug effects*",2010 Oct 15

This analysis evaluated the strength of the correlation between ESS and MWT with regard to absolute values in scores.
Data were analyzed separately from the intent-to-treat populations of two eight-week clinical trials of sodium oxybate for the treatment of narcolepsy, SXB-15 and SXB-22. For all treatment groups, correlations between ESS and MWT were evaluated at baseline, week four, and week eight using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient.
Overall, correlations across all treatment groups in each study described an inverse relationship, reflecting the scoring of each measure (ie, whereas higher ESS scores indicate greater sleepiness, higher MWT scores indicate a greater ability to remain awake). Significant correlations of low-to-moderate strength were observed at all time points in both studies. In SXB-15, correlation coefficients were -0.272, -0.365, and -0.343 at baseline (n = 221), week four (n = 212), and week eight (n = 205), respectively, with all P < 0.0001.

Although all correlations showed statistical significance, they were of low-to-moderate strength. These results indicate that ESS and MWT measure features of pathologic sleepiness that may be distinct, but partially overlapping. These data corroborate those of other studies, suggesting that physiologic mechanisms that regulate alertness and sleep propensity may function somewhat independently.Adolescent Adult Aged Humans Middle Aged Narcolepsy / diagnosis* Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Patient Reported Outcome Measures Sleep / drug effects Sodium Oxybate / therapeutic use* Treatment Outcome Wakefulness / drug effects* Wakefulness-Promoting Agents / therapeutic use* Young Adult",2017 Oct

Efficacy was assessed using the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) (six 20-min subtests across the day), the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C), subjective measures of sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale), patient diaries, and evaluations of cognitive performance (Cognitive Drug Research) and fatigue (Brief Fatigue Inventory).
Armodafinil significantly increased MWT mean sleep latency (at 0900-1500) compared with placebo. The mean change from baseline at final visit for armodafinil was an increase of 1.3, 2.6, and 1.9 min in the 150-mg, 250-mg, and combined groups, respectively, compared with a decrease of 1.9 min for placebo (p < 0.01 for all three comparisons).

In 16 drug-free narcoleptics and 16 normal controls a baseline 3-min vigilance-controlled EEG (V-EEG) and a 4-min resting EEG (R-EEG) were recorded during midmorning hours. Thereafter, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, patients were treated with a 3-week fixed titration of modafinil (200, 300, 400 mg) and placebo. EEG-mapping, MSLT and ESS measures were obtained before and at the end of the third week of therapy. Statistical overall analysis by means of the omnibus significance test demonstrated significant EEG differences between untreated patients and controls in the resting condition only (R-EEG). Subsequent univariate analysis revealed an increase in absolute and relative theta power, a decrease in alpha-2 and beta power as well as a slowing of the dominant frequency and the centroids of the alpha, beta and total power spectrum and thus objectified a vigilance decrement in narcolepsy. Modafinil 400 mg/d significantly improved vigilance as compared with placebo (p < or = 0.01), inducing changes opposite to the aforementioned baseline differences (key-lock principle). The MSLT and the ESS also improved under modafinil as compared with placebo, but changes were less consistent. Spearman rank correlations revealed the highest correlations between EEG mapping and the ESS, followed by those between EEG mapping and the MSLT, while the lowest correlation was found between the MSLT and the ESS. In conclusion, EEG mapping is a valuable instrument for measuring vigilance decrements in narcolepsy and their improvement under psychostimulant treatment.Adult Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use* Brain Mapping* Case-Control Studies Double-Blind Method Electroencephalography / drug effects* Evaluation Studies as Topic Female Humans Male Middle Aged Modafinil Multivariate Analysis Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Narcolepsy / physiopathology Neuroprotective Agents / therapeutic use* Neuropsychological Tests / statistics & numerical data Placebos Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Reaction Time / drug effects Statistics, Nonparametric Surveys and Questionnaires Treatment Outcome",2005 Feb

Modafinil is a wakefulness-promoting drug approved for patients with excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. We evaluated the effect of single doses of modafinil (200 mg) and placebo in patients recovering from general anesthesia. Thirty-four subjects participated in this prospective, randomized, double-blind study approved by our IRB. Preoperatively, patients were asked to rate various symptoms they had experienced over the previous 24-h using a verbal analog scale (VAS) of 0 to 10 as well as discrete scale when indicated. Postoperatively, once the patient was able to tolerate oral intake and met our institutional discharge criteria, the study drug (modafinil 200 mg or placebo) was administered with a sip of water. Patients were contacted 24 (1) hours after dosing to evaluate postdischarge symptoms. Patients in the placebo group reported significantly more postoperative fatigue (4.8 [3.3] versus 1.4 [1.8]), exhaustion (4.3 [3.3] versus 2.4 [3.1]), or degree of feeling worn out (4.7 [3.6] versus 2.9 [2.4]). Significantly more patients reported moderate to severe fatigue in the placebo group (65% versus 12%). Two major themes of ""alertness"" and ""energy"" were expressed by 71% of the patients receiving modafinil versus 18% of those receiving placebo. Patients recovering from general anesthesia can significantly benefit from modafinil.
Modafinil significantly reduces fatigue and improves feelings of alertness and energy in postoperative patients.

In this 9-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 21-center clinical trial, patients were randomized to receive fixed daily doses of modafinil 200 mg, modafinil 400 mg, or placebo. A placebo-controlled, 2-week treatment discontinuation phase was included to evaluate the effects of withdrawal on patients who had been receiving modafinil. A total of 271 patients who were naive to modafinil received study medication in the 9-week trial and 240 patients received study medication in the discontinuation phase.
Treatment with modafinil resulted in significant improvement in two objective measures of EDS: the Multiple Sleep Latency Test and the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test. Additionally, patient self-assessment of sleepiness was significantly improved, as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and level of illness was significantly reduced on the independent clinician assessment, the Clinical Global Impression of Change. Nighttime sleep, monitored by nocturnal polysomnography, was not adversely effected with modafinil treatment compared with placebo treatment. The most frequent adverse experience was headache, which was not significantly greater for modafinil than placebo. During treatment discontinuation, individuals who had been receiving modafinil experienced a return of their EDS to baseline levels. During treatment discontinuation, patients did not experience symptoms associated with amphetamine withdrawal syndrome. For up to 9 weeks of daily use there was no evidence for the development of dependence at the dose levels studied.
The data indicate that modafinil has an excellent safety profile and is very well tolerated. Modafinil is an effective treatment for excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy and shows continued efficacy with up to 9 weeks of daily use.Adolescent Adult Aged Benzhydryl Compounds / adverse effects Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use* Double-Blind Method Female Humans Male Middle Aged Modafinil Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Narcolepsy / physiopathology* Polysomnography Reaction Time / physiology Sleep / drug effects Sleep / physiology* Wakefulness / physiology",2000 Mar 14

Study subjects were 136 narcolepsy patients with 3 to 249 (median 21) cataplexy attacks weekly.
Prior to baseline measures, subjects discontinued anticataplectic medications. Stable doses of stimulants were permitted. Subjects were randomized in blinded fashion to receive 3, 6, or 9 g doses of sodium oxybate or placebo taken in equally divided doses upon retiring to bed and 2.5-4 hours later for 4 weeks.
Disease symptoms and adverse events were recorded in daily diaries. The primary measure of efficacy was the change from baseline in weekly cataplexy attacks. Secondary measures included daytime sleepiness using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), inadvertent daytime naps/sleep attacks and nighttime awakenings. Investigators assessed changes in disease severity using Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-c). Compared to placebo, weekly cataplexy attacks were decreased by sodium oxybate at the 6 g dose (p=0.0529) and significantly at the 9 g dose (p=0.0008). The ESS was reduced at all doses, becoming significant at the 9 g dose (p=0.0001). The CGI-c demonstrated a dose-related improvement, significant at the 9 g dose (p=0.0002). The frequency of inadvertent naps/sleep attacks and the nighttime awakenings showed similar dose-response trends, becoming significant at the 9 g dose (p=0.0122 and p=0.0035, respectively). Sodium oxybate was generally well-tolerated at all three doses. Nausea, headache, dizziness and enuresis were the most commonly reported adverse events.

EDS improved significantly in patients with TBI who were treated with modafinil, compared with the placebo group. Similarly, the ability to stay awake on the maintenance of wakefulness test improved only in the modafinil group. Modafinil, however, had no impact on posttraumatic fatigue. Clinically relevant side effects were not observed.

We HLA typed 509 patients enrolled in a clinical trial for the drug modafinil and analyzed the results in relation to cataplexy, a symptom of narcolepsy characterized by muscle weakness triggered by emotions. The patients were either subjects with cataplexy who had a mean sleep latency (SL) of less than 8 minutes and two or more sleep onset rapid eye movement (REM) periods (SOREMPs) during a multiple sleep latency test, or narcoleptic patients without cataplexy but with a mean SL shorter than 5 minutes and two or more SOREMPs. The respective values of DRB1*15 (DR2) and DQB1*0602 as markers for narcolepsy were first compared in different ethnic groups and in patients with and without cataplexy. DQB1*0602 was found to be a more sensitive marker for narcolepsy than DRB1*15 across all ethnic groups. DQB1*0602 frequency was strikingly higher in patients with cataplexy versus patients without cataplexy (76.1% in 421 patients versus 40.9% in 88 patients). Positivity was highest in patients with severe cataplexy (94.8%) and progressively decreased to 54.2% in patients with the mildest cataplexy. A voluntary 50-item questionnaire focusing on cataplexy was also analyzed in 212 of the 509 HLA-typed patients. Subjects with definite cataplexy as observed by an experienced clinician were more frequently HLA DQB1*0602-positive than those with doubtful cataplexy, and the manifestations of cataplexy were clinically more typical in DQB1*0602-positive patients. These results show that the HLA association is as tight as previously reported (85-95%) when cataplexy is clinically typical or severe. We also found that patients with mild, atypical, or no cataplexy have a significantly increased DQB1*0602 frequency (40-60%) in comparison with ethnically matched controls (24%).

The cognitive task battery included subjective assessments of mood, fatigue, affect, vigor and motivation, and cognitive assessments of serial reaction time, logical reasoning, visual comparison, mental addition and vigilance. In addition, trial-by-trial confidence judgements were obtained for two of the cognitive tasks and more global, task level assessments of performance were obtained for four of the cognitive tasks. Relative to placebo, modafinil improved fatigue levels, motivation, reaction time and vigilance. In terms of self-assessments of cognitive performance, both the placebo and modafinil conditions were 'well calibrated' on trial-by-trial confidence judgements, showing neither marked over- nor under-confidence. Of note, the modafinil condition displayed a non-significant tendency towards 'overconfidence' for task-level assessments of performance.

Central apneas in patients treated with SXB increased, and clinically significant oxygen desaturations were seen in three patients with SXB treatment. The most common treatment related adverse events were headache and nausea.
These results suggest that nighttime administration of 9g SXB in patients with mild to moderate OSAS does not negatively impact SDB, as measured by mean change from baseline in AHI and SaO(2), but might increase central apneas and cause oxygen desaturation in some individuals and should be used with caution.Adjuvants, Anesthesia / adverse effects* Adjuvants, Anesthesia / therapeutic use Adult Aged Benzhydryl Compounds / adverse effects* Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use Central Nervous System Stimulants / adverse effects* Central Nervous System Stimulants / therapeutic use Comorbidity Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Cross-Over Studies Double-Blind Method Drug Therapy, Combination Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions Female Humans Hypnotics and Sedatives / adverse effects* Hypnotics and Sedatives / therapeutic use Male Middle Aged Modafinil Narcolepsy / drug therapy Narcolepsy / epidemiology Oxygen / blood Polysomnography / drug effects* Product Surveillance, Postmarketing Pyridines / adverse effects* Pyridines / therapeutic use Sleep Apnea, Obstructive / drug therapy* Sleep Apnea, Obstructive / epidemiology Sleep Stages / drug effects Sodium Oxybate / adverse effects* Sodium Oxybate / therapeutic use Zolpidem",2010 Jan

Administrations of modafinil or placebo in a subject were separated by a 2-week washout. Brain SPECT was performed twice before and 3 h after modafinil or placebo administration. For statistical parametric mapping analysis, all SPECT images were spatially normalized to the standard SPECT template and then smoothed using a 12-mm full width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel. The paired t-test was used to compare pre- versus post-modafinil and pre- versus post-placebo SPECT images. Differences in rCBF between post-modafinil and post-placebo conditions were also tested. Modafinil decreased Epworth and Stanford sleepiness scales whereas placebo did not.

However, it has been reported that healthy individuals without wakefulness disorders are using modafinil off-label to enhance cognitive functioning. Although some studies have reported that modafinil improves cognitive task performance in healthy volunteers, numerous other studies have failed to detect cognitive enhancing effects of modafinil on several well-established neuropsychological tasks. Interestingly, several clinical and preclinical studies have found that improved cognitive task performance by modafinil is accompanied by slower response times. This observation raises the question as to whether this slowing of response time in healthy volunteers is a necessary and sufficient condition for cognitive enhancement with modafinil. The aim of the current experiment was to explore this question by investigating the effects of modafinil on the Hayling Sentence Completion Test (HSCT).
Sixty-four healthy volunteers received either a single dose (200 mg) of modafinil (n = 32) or placebo (n = 32) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in which the principal outcome measures were response latencies on the response initiation and response inhibition sections of the HSCT.
Participants dosed with modafinil had significantly longer mean response latencies on the HSCT for both the response initiation and response inhibition compared to participants dosed with placebo. However, participants in both groups made a similar number of errors on each of these measures, indicating that modafinil did not enhance the accuracy of performance of the task relative to placebo.
This study demonstrated that administration of single 200 mg doses of modafinil to healthy individuals increased the latency of responses in the performance of the HSCT, a task that is highly sensitive to prefrontal executive function, without enhancing accuracy of performance. This finding may provide important clues to defining the limitations of modafinil as a putative cognitive enhancer.

Modafinil has become a standard therapy for improving daytime wakefulness in narcolepsy patients and may be a useful therapeutic alternative to psychostimulants used to improve waking function in other medical conditions. Modafinil is chemically dissimilar to and has a pharmacological profile that differs from the psychostimulants. Modafinil has a low abuse potential and is well tolerated.
Patients (N=151) with narcolepsy who had been unsatisfactorily treated with dextroamphetamine (N=48), methylphenidate (N=66), or pemoline (N=37) were enrolled in this 6-week, open-label, multicenter study. Following a 2-week washout period, patients received modafinil once daily (Week 1, 200 mg; Weeks 2-6, 200 or 400 mg). Efficacy was evaluated at Weeks 1, 2, and 6 using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the Clinical Global Impression of Change. Adverse events were monitored throughout the study.
Treatment with modafinil improved daytime wakefulness versus baseline regardless of which psychostimulant was taken previously. Mean ESS scores were improved after 1 week of treatment with modafinil. Improvements were maintained throughout the 6 weeks of treatment (all P<0.001 versus baseline after washout). At Week 6, 79% of all patients were considered to be clinically improved relative to post-washout baseline. The most frequent adverse events were headache, nausea, and insomnia; the majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in nature. Approximately 70% of patients were receiving 400 mg of modafinil once daily at the end of the study.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of modafinil on working memory processes in humans and how they are related to noradrenergic stimulation of the prefrontal cortex.
Sixteen healthy volunteers (aged 20-29 years) received either modafinil 200 mg or placebo using a double blind crossover design. Two computerized working memory tasks were administered, a numeric manipulation task that requires short-term maintenance of digit-sequences and different degrees of manipulation as well as delayed matching task that assesses maintenance of visuo-spatial information over varying delay lengths. The battery was supplemented by standardized paper pencil tasks of attentional functions.
Modafinil significantly reduced error rates in the long delay condition of the visuo-spatial task and in the manipulation conditions, but not in the maintenance condition of the numeric task. Analyses of reaction times showed no speed-accuracy trade-off. Attentional control tasks (letter cancellation, trail-making, catch trials) were not affected by modafinil.

Amphetamine remains a widely abused drug throughout the world, although it is also used therapeutically for weight loss, narcolepsy, and attention-deficit disorder with hyperactivity (ADHD). Treatment of ADHD using stimulant drugs is much more common now than it was in even the recent past. Increasingly, older individuals are diagnosed and treated for ADHD, and treatment often continues into adulthood. Amphetamine is commonly used for the treatment of ADHD and is available by prescription as either the d-enantiomer or a mixture of enantiomers. Although used for many years, there are no data available to describe the excretion profile of amphetamine and its enantiomers following repeated use of the drug. As a result, medical review officers (MROs) and forensic toxicologists have no direct evidence to base their decisions on when it comes to evaluation of use of these drugs. The current study was designed to determine the concentration and enantiomer excretion profile following repeated daily administration of mixed enantiomers of amphetamine. Twenty milligrams of Adderall was administered daily to five healthy subjects with all subsequent ad lib urine samples collected for at least five days following administration of the five-dose regimen. Adderall is a 3:1 mixture of d- and l-enantiomers of amphetamine salts and represents the mixed enantiomer proportion of amphetamine available in the United States through pharmaceutical channels. Peak amphetamine concentrations ranged from 5739 to 19,172 ng/mL. Samples containing > or = 500 ng/mL amphetamine (the administrative cutoff for a positive result by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) were seen up to 60:15 (h:min) following administration of the last dose. Enantiomer analysis showed the d-enantiomer to be in excess of the l-enantiomer for as long as the drug was administered. After administration of the last dose of drug, the proportion of l-enantiomer increased over time. Not all samples that contained > or = 500 ng/mL total amphetamine were positive when tested by immunoassay because of the differing cross-reactivity of the enantiomers. This study provides the first description of the excretion of amphetamine following repeated administration of Adderall. The presence of the l-enantiomer separates this drug from other formulations composed of only the d-enantiomer (i.e., Dexedrine and much illicit amphetamine), thus readily differentiating them from Adderall use. Some illicit and medicinal amphetamine is, however, a mixture of amphetamine enantiomers. Because the enantiomers are metabolized at different rates, their proportion offers the opportunity to describe excretion versus time. Coupling this data with drug concentration makes it possible for forensic toxicologists and MROs to come to an informed decision regarding the involvement of this drug in a positive drug test result.Administration, Oral Adult Amphetamine / urine* Amphetamines / administration & dosage Amphetamines / pharmacokinetics* Amphetamines / urine Central Nervous System Stimulants / administration & dosage Central Nervous System Stimulants / pharmacokinetics* Central Nervous System Stimulants / urine Dextroamphetamine / urine* Humans Hydrogen-Ion Concentration Male Middle Aged Substance Abuse Detection Time Factors",2004 Oct

An open, 3 x 3 Latin square, randomized, cross-over study was performed in healthy males to compare the pharmacokinetics of single-dose oral modafinil (200 mg) and methylphenidate (40 mg) administered alone or in combination. Blood samples were obtained for analysis of d- and l-threo-methylphenidate and modafinil and its acid and sulfone metabolites. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by noncompartmental methods, but could not be evaluated for modafinil sulfone due to plasma levels that were close to the assay quantitation limit. Although sporadic differences in plasma concentrations were observed between treatments, coadministration of modafinil and methylphenidate did not significantly alter the plasma concentrations of modafinil, modafinil acid, modafinil sulfone, or methylphenidate enantiomers compared with administration of these agents alone. Half-life (t1/2), maximum concentration (Cmax), area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-infinity), total clearance (Cl/F), and apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) for modafinil and t1/2, Cmax, and AUC0-infinity for modafinil acid were not affected by concomitant administration of methylphenidate. Small but statistically significant increases in time to Cmax (tmax) were observed for modafinil and modafinil acid after methylphenidate coadministration compared with modafinil alone. Modafinil coadministration did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of d- or l-threo-methylphenidate, except for a small decrease in Vd/F of l-threo-methylphenidate. Concomitant methylphenidate may cause a delay in the oral absorption of modafinil, but this delay might not be relevant clinically. Coadministration did not alter the extent of oral absorption and disposition of either agent. Therefore, a pharmacokinetic interaction between modafinil and methylphenidate would be unlikely.Adolescent Adrenergic Agents / administration & dosage Adrenergic Agents / adverse effects Adrenergic Agents / pharmacokinetics* Adrenergic Agents / pharmacology Adult Benzhydryl Compounds / administration & dosage Benzhydryl Compounds / adverse effects Benzhydryl Compounds / pharmacokinetics* Benzhydryl Compounds / pharmacology Central Nervous System Stimulants / administration & dosage Central Nervous System Stimulants / adverse effects Central Nervous System Stimulants / pharmacokinetics* Central Nervous System Stimulants / pharmacology Cross-Over Studies Double-Blind Method Drug Interactions Humans Male Methylphenidate / administration & dosage Methylphenidate / adverse effects Methylphenidate / pharmacokinetics* Methylphenidate / pharmacology Middle Aged Modafinil",1998 Mar

The aetiology of EDS is probably multifactorial but is probably exacerbated by dopaminergic medications. Modafinil is a wake-promoting agent approved for use in narcolepsy, but it is often used to treat a variety of somnolent conditions.
A double blind, placebo controlled parallel design trial was conducted to assess the efficacy of modafinil (200-400 mg/day) for the treatment of EDS in PD. The primary efficacy measure was the Epworth Sleepiness (ES) scale score. Secondary efficacy points included the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the Fatigue Severity Scale, the Hamilton Depression Scale, and the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT).
Of a total of 40 subjects (29 men, mean (SD) age 64.8 (11.3) years), randomised to modafinil or placebo, 37 completed the study. Modafinil failed to significantly improve ES scores compared with placebo (2.7 v 1.5 points improvement, respectively, p = 0.28). MSLT failed to improve with modafinil relative to placebo (-0.16 v -0.70, respectively, p = 0.14). UPDRS, global impressions, Fatigue Severity Scale, and Hamilton Depression Scale scores were unchanged. Adverse events were minimal.

For this purpose, eight healthy young men were enrolled in a double blind trial to test the effects of modafinil on daily plasma melatonin, cortisol and growth hormone (GH) rhythms. Blood was sampled for hormone assays, every hour during the daytime and every 30 min during the nighttime. In addition, rectal temperature and mental performances were determined during the study which comprised 3 sessions, two weeks apart: a 24 h control session including a night with sleep (S1) and two 48 h sessions S2 and S3 with a sleep-deprived night (N1) followed by a recovery night (N2). Modafinil (300 mg x 2) or placebo were randomly attributed during N1 at 22 h and 8 h. As expected, performance was improved after modafinil administration and body temperature was maintained or increased. Plasma melatonin and cortisol profiles were similar after modafinil and placebo administration. The levels observed during the recovery and the control nights (N2) displayed no difference. For GH, during both sleep deprived nights, secretion was dramatically reduced compared with the control one, although the number of secretory episodes was unchanged. These data show that the alerting property of modafinil is not related to an alteration of hormone profiles and suggest that the acute modafinil administration is devoid of short-term side-effects.Adult Benzhydryl Compounds / pharmacology* Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use Body Temperature / drug effects* Central Nervous System Stimulants / pharmacology* Central Nervous System Stimulants / therapeutic use Health Status Human Growth Hormone / metabolism* Humans Hydrocortisone / metabolism* Male Melatonin / blood* Melatonin / metabolism* Modafinil Narcolepsy / drug therapy Narcolepsy / etiology Psychomotor Performance / drug effects* Rectum* Sleep Deprivation* Time Factors",1998 Jun

In patients with excessive sleepiness associated with shift work disorder, treated obstructive sleep apnoea, or narcolepsy, armodafinil has been found to improve wakefulness throughout the shift or day. In addition, while not approved for this indication, armodafinil has been found to improve excessive sleepiness associated with jet-lag disorder.
This study evaluated systemic exposure to armodafinil and its two major circulating metabolites, R-modafinil acid and modafinil sulfone, and assessed the tolerability profile of armodafinil in elderly and young subjects.
The pharmacokinetics and tolerability of armodafinil were assessed in an open-label, multiple-dose, parallel-group study in two groups (n = 25 in each group) of healthy men (elderly group aged ≥65 years and young group aged 18-45 years) who received armodafinil 50 mg on day 1, 100 mg on day 2 and 150 mg once daily on days 3 through 7. Plasma concentrations of armodafinil and its metabolites were quantified over 72 hours following the last dose on day 7. Pharmacokinetic parameters, including area under the plasma drug concentration-versus-time curve during a dosing interval (AUC(τ)) and maximum observed plasma drug concentration (C(max)), and tolerability were assessed.
All 50 subjects enrolled in the study were evaluable for tolerability and 49 were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis. One elderly subject was excluded from the pharmacokinetic analyses because of apparent noncompliance with armodafinil dosing. Systemic exposure following administration of armodafinil, as measured by steady-state AUC(τ) and C(max) values, was approximately 15% greater in elderly subjects compared with young subjects. Geometric mean ratios for AUC(τ) and C(max) in the two groups were 1.14 (95% CI 1.03, 1.25; p = 0.0086) and 1.15 (95% CI 1.08, 1.24; p = 0.0002), respectively. When data were analysed for elderly subgroups, systemic exposure in the old-elderly group (age ≥75 years; n = 7) was 27% greater than in young subjects, as compared with 10% greater in the young-elderly group (age 65-74 years; n = 17). Although steady-state exposure to the metabolite R-modafinil acid was also higher in elderly than in young subjects (geometric mean ratios for AUC(τ) and C(max) were 1.73 and 1.61, respectively; p < 0.0001), there were no significant differences in systemic exposure to modafinil sulfone. Armodafinil was generally well tolerated by both groups. Headache (four subjects in each group), nausea (one in the elderly group and four in the young group), insomnia (two in the elderly group and one in the young group), and dizziness (two in the young group) were the most common adverse events.
Systemic exposure following administration of armodafinil is increased in the elderly in comparison with younger subjects, particularly in those aged ≥75 years. Although the increase in plasma armodafinil concentration in elderly subjects does not appear to result in more adverse events compared with young subjects, consideration should be given to the use of lower dosages of armodafinil for the management of excessive sleepiness in older patients, particularly the very elderly.Adult Age Factors Aged Area Under Curve Benzhydryl Compounds / administration & dosage* Benzhydryl Compounds / adverse effects* Benzhydryl Compounds / blood Benzhydryl Compounds / pharmacokinetics Central Nervous System Stimulants / administration & dosage* Central Nervous System Stimulants / adverse effects* Central Nervous System Stimulants / blood Central Nervous System Stimulants / pharmacokinetics Humans Male Modafinil Wakefulness / drug effects",2011 Feb 1

This 5-week, randomized, open-label study evaluated three strategies for switching patients from methylphenidate, a commonly used psychostimulant, to modafinil.
Patients ( n=40) with excessive daytime sleepiness related to narcolepsy, who had received previous treatment with methylphenidate, were switched from methylphenidate to modafinil (200 mg/day followed by 400 mg/day) without a washout period between treatments, with a 2-day washout period between treatments, or by using a taper-down/titrate-up protocol. Adverse events were recorded throughout the study, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores were determined at the end of the study.
The majority of patients (95%) were successfully switched to modafinil. At the study end point, mean Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores were <12 for each treatment group. All three switching strategies were well tolerated, with adverse events mild or moderate in nature. Adverse events most frequently reported during modafinil treatment were among those seen previously in large-scale, placebo-controlled studies. There were no meaningful differences among the treatment groups in the frequency or severity of adverse events or in their relationship to modafinil treatment. Only one patient discontinued modafinil treatment because of a treatment-related adverse event (i.e. moderate headache); another patient discontinued due to insufficient efficacy.
Switching from methylphenidate to modafinil was well tolerated with or without a washout period or when the methylphenidate dose is gradually tapered during initiation of modafinil therapy. Daytime wakefulness was maintained in patients who have switched from methylphenidate to modafinil. These data suggest that patients with narcolepsy may be switched from methylphenidate to modafinil with few complications and inconveniences.Adolescent Adult Aged Benzhydryl Compounds / therapeutic use* Central Nervous System Stimulants / therapeutic use* Drug Administration Schedule Female Humans Male Methylphenidate / therapeutic use* Middle Aged Modafinil Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Treatment Outcome Wakefulness / drug effects",2003 Jun

Exclusion criteria included a diagnosis of narcolepsy, sleep apnoea, or clinically significant major systemic disease and recent use of medications affecting fatigue. All patients, who remained blinded for the treatment regimen, received placebo during weeks 1-2, 200 mg/day modafinil during weeks 3-4, 400 mg/day modafinil during weeks 5-6, and placebo during weeks 7-9. Safety was evaluated by unblinded investigators. Efficacy was evaluated by self rating scales, using the FSS, the modified fatigue impact scale (MFIS), a visual analogue scale for fatigue (VAS-F), and the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS).

Seventy two patients (MS type: 74% relapsing-remitting; 7% primary progressive; 19% secondary progressive) received treatment. After treatment with 200 mg/day modafinil for 2 weeks, a significant improvement in fatigue versus placebo run in was demonstrated. Mean scores after treatment with 200 mg/day modafinil were: FSS, 4.7 versus 5.5 for placebo (p<0.001); MFIS, 37.7 versus 44.7 (p<0.001); and VAS-F, 5.4 versus 4.5 (p=0.003).

Rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep expression is strongly circadian modulated, and the impact of REM sleep on primary brain functions, metabolic processes, and immune system function has become increasingly clear over the past decade. In our study, we evaluated the effects of exogenous melatonin on disturbed REM sleep in humans. Fourteen consecutive outpatients (five women, nine men; mean age, 50 yr) with unselected neuropsychiatric sleep disorders and reduced REM sleep duration (25% or more below age norm according to diagnostic polysomnography) were included in two consecutive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design clinical trials. Patients received 3 mg melatonin daily, administered between 2200 and 2300 h for 4 wk. The results of the study show that melatonin was significantly more effective than placebo: patients on melatonin experienced significant increases in REM sleep percentage (baseline/melatonin, 14.7/17.8 vs. baseline/placebo, 14.3/12.0) and improvements in subjective measures of daytime dysfunction as well as clinical global impression score. Melatonin did not shift circadian phase or suppress temperature but did increase REM sleep continuity and promote decline in rectal temperature during sleep. These results were confirmed in patients who received melatonin in the second study (REM sleep percentage baseline/placebo/melatonin, 14.3/12.0/17.9). In patients who received melatonin in the first study and placebo in the second, the above mentioned effects outlasted the period of melatonin administration and diminished only slowly over time (REM sleep percentage baseline/melatonin/placebo, 14.7/17.8/16.2). Our findings show that exogenous melatonin, when administered at the appropriate time, seems to normalize circadian variation in human physiology. It may, therefore, have a strong impact on general health, especially in the elderly and in shift workers.Adult Aged Circadian Rhythm / drug effects Double-Blind Method Female Humans Male Melatonin / administration & dosage* Melatonin / analogs & derivatives* Melatonin / urine Middle Aged Narcolepsy / drug therapy Nocturnal Myoclonus Syndrome / drug therapy Placebos Restless Legs Syndrome / drug therapy Sleep Wake Disorders / drug therapy* Sleep, REM* / drug effects Time Factors",2004 Jan

In this study, we evaluated the effects of 20 mg of temazepam on daytime sleep, the subsequent levels of nocturnal alertness/sleepiness, and performance in a laboratory simulation of acute night shift. For evaluating alertness, sleepiness, and performance we used, respectively, the maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT), the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), and two pencil and paper tests: digit symbol substitution test (DSST) and deux barrages test (DBT). All tests were administered four times at 2-hour intervals during the nighttime after daytime sleep. Results showed that the ability to maintain wakefulness (MWT) and to perform some visuo-attentive tasks were substantially maintained during the night. On the other hand, sleep tendency (MSLT) linearly increased during the night.

The overnight PSGs indicated that the narcolepsy patients had the following significant results during GHB versus placebo treatment: decreased stage 1 (p = 0.012), increased stage 3 (p = 0.008), increased delta (stage 3 and 4 combined) sleep (p = 0.049), fewer stage shifts (p = 0.002), and fewer awakenings (p = 0.006). Minutes of wakefulness were significantly increased only for the last 2 h of the 8 h sleep period on GHB versus placebo (p = 0.019), which is beyond the time of GHB's direct influence. The MSLTs indicated that the narcolepsy patients had a marginally increased sleep latency mean during GHB versus placebo treatment (p = 0.074) and significantly increased total stage 0 (wakefulness) on day 29 of GHB versus day 29 of placebo treatment (p = 0.038).

The therapeutic effect of GHB in narcolepsy patients, i.e., decreases cataplexy, appears to be due to its improving nocturnal sleep quality, since its half-life is only 1.5 to 2 h. It is conjectured that GHB, an endogenous neurochemical, may be a sleep neurotransmitter or neuromodulator, since GHB rapidly induces sleep, and increases sleep continuity and delta sleep without suppressing REM sleep in both normals and narcolepsy patients.Adult Double-Blind Method Electroencephalography Electromyography Electrooculography Female Humans Male Middle Aged Narcolepsy / drug therapy* Narcolepsy / physiopathology Sleep / drug effects* Sleep / physiology Sodium Oxybate / pharmacology* Sodium Oxybate / therapeutic use Wakefulness / drug effects Wakefulness / physiology",1990 Dec

Eight hypocretin-deficient male narcolepsy type 1 patients and eight healthy matched controls underwent temperature measurement of core body and proximal and distal skin twice, and the sleep-wake state for 24 h. After the baseline assessment, 2 × 3 g of sodium oxybate was administered for 5 nights, immediately followed by the second assessment. At baseline, daytime core body temperature and proximal skin temperature were significantly lower in patients with narcolepsy (core: 36.8 ± 0.05 °C versus 37.0 ± 0.05 °C, F = 8.31, P = 0.01; proximal: 33.4 ± 0.26 °C versus 34.3 ± 0.26 °C, F = 5.66, P = 0.03). In patients, sodium oxybate administration increased proximal skin temperature during the day (F = 6.46, P = 0.04) to a level similar as in controls, but did not affect core body temperature, distal temperature or distal-proximal temperature gradient. Sodium oxybate administration normalised the predictive value of distal skin temperature and distal-proximal temperature gradient for the onset of daytime naps (P < 0.01). In conclusion, sodium oxybate administration resulted in a partial normalisation of the skin temperature profile, by increasing daytime proximal skin temperature, and by strengthening the known relationship between skin temperature and daytime sleep propensity. These changes seem to be related to the clinical improvement induced by sodium oxybate treatment.

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal trial of LXB, TEAEs were evaluated during the 12-week OLOTTP, the 2-week SDP, and the subsequent 24-week OLE. Eligible participants were aged 18-70 years with a diagnosis of narcolepsy with cataplexy. At study entry, participants were taking sodium oxybate (SXB) alone, SXB with other anticataplectics, other anticataplectics alone, or were anticataplectic-treatment naive; other anticataplectics were tapered and discontinued during the OLOTTP. All participants initiated LXB during week 1 of the OLOTTP, and their dose was individually titrated based on safety and efficacy. Following the main study period, participants entered the OLE after rescreening (re-entry) after discontinuing LXB treatment or directly after completing the main study (rollover). TEAEs were assessed in the safety population as of database lock. TEAE duration was defined as time from TEAE start date to end date (or end of SDP or OLE, if end date was unrecorded).
The safety population included 201 participants (SXB alone, n = 52; SXB with other anticataplectics, n = 23; other anticataplectics alone, n = 36; anticataplectic-treatment naive, n = 90). During the OLOTTP/SDP, headache was the most common LXB-emergent TEAE overall (71 events; n = 42 (21%); median (range) duration = 1 (1-147) day), followed by nausea (31 events; n = 26 (13%); median (range) duration = 9 (1-54) days) and dizziness (26 events; n = 21 (10%); median (range) duration = 7 (1-117) days). Among the 74 participants in the OLE, the most commonly reported TEAEs were headache (14 events; n = 7, 9%; peak incidence month 3 (n = 5/72); median (range) duration = 1 (1‒25) day), dizziness (8 events; n = 5, 7%; peak incidence month 1 (n = 3/74); median (range) duration = 26 (1‒181) days), and nasopharyngitis (6 events; n = 6, 8%; peak incidence month 6 (n = 2/69); median (range) duration = 9 (1‒24) days). Overall, study discontinuations attributed to TEAEs were 21/65 (32%) during the OLOTTP and SDP and 3/7 (43%) during the OLE.
In this long-term analysis, the safety and tolerability profile of LXB was generally consistent with the known safety profile of SXB. During the OLOTTP and SDP, most TEAEs occurred early and were generally of short duration. TEAE prevalence decreased throughout the duration of the OLE; the most common TEAEs reported during the OLE were headache, dizziness, and nasopharyngitis.

Low-sodium oxybate (LXB) is a medicine for narcolepsy. LXB treats daytime sleepiness and cataplexy (sudden muscle weakness). LXB is like sodium oxybate (SXB) but has 92% less sodium. This study looked at side effects in people taking LXB for many months. Three study periods were looked at in this report. In period 1, people could change their LXB dose for 12 weeks. This was to find their best dose. In period 2, people took that same best dose for 2 weeks. In period 3, some people kept taking LXB for 24 weeks. This was to study the longer-term effects. Everyone knew that they were taking LXB. During periods 1 and 2, the most common side effect was headache. Nausea and dizziness were also common. During period 3, headache was also the most common side effect. Dizziness and nasopharyngitis were also common. Nasopharyngitis is a cold in the nose and throat. In periods 1 and 2, most side effects happened early on. They also ended quickly. Fewer side effects happened in period 3. Among people leaving the study early, 32% left because of side effects during periods 1 and 2. During period 3, 43% left because of side effects. Overall, long-term side effects in people taking LXB were similar to those seen with SXB.Adult Cataplexy* / drug therapy Dizziness / chemically induced Dizziness / drug therapy Double-Blind Method Headache / drug therapy Humans Narcolepsy* / drug therapy Nasopharyngitis* / chemically induced Nasopharyngitis* / drug therapy Sodium Oxybate* / adverse effects Time Factors Treatment Outcome",2023 Apr

To determine whether nocturnal administration of sodium oxybate, a first-line treatment in narcolepsy, is effective and safe for excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and disturbed nighttime sleep in patients with PD.
Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover phase 2a study carried out between January 9, 2015, and February 24, 2017. In a single-center study in the sleep laboratory at the University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, 18 patients with PD and EDS (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS] score >10) were screened in the sleep laboratory. Five patients were excluded owing to the polysomnographic diagnosis of sleep apnea and 1 patient withdrew consent. Thus, 12 patients were randomized to a treatment sequence (sodium oxybate followed by placebo or placebo followed by sodium oxybate, ratio 1:1) and, after dropout of 1 patient owing to an unrelated adverse event during the washout period, 11 patients completed the study. Two patients developed obstructive sleep apnea during sodium oxybate treatment (1 was the dropout) and were excluded from the per-protocol analysis (n = 10) but included in the intention-to-treat analysis (n = 12).
Nocturnal sodium oxybate and placebo taken at bedtime and 2.5 to 4.0 hours later with an individually titrated dose between 3.0 and 9.0 g per night for 6 weeks with a 2- to 4-week washout period interposed.
Primary outcome measure was change of objective EDS as electrophysiologically measured by mean sleep latency in the Multiple Sleep Latency Test. Secondary outcome measures included change of subjective EDS (ESS), sleep quality (Parkinson Disease Sleep Scale-2), and objective variables of nighttime sleep (polysomnography).
Among 12 patients in the intention-to-treat population (10 men, 2 women; mean [SD] age, 62 [11.1] years; disease duration, 8.4 [4.6] years), sodium oxybate substantially improved EDS as measured objectively (mean sleep latency, +2.9 minutes; 95% CI, 2.1 to 3.8 minutes; P = .002) and subjectively (ESS score, -4.2 points ; 95% CI, -5.3 to -3.0 points; P = .001). Thereby, 8 (67%) patients exhibited an electrophysiologically defined positive treatment response. Moreover, sodium oxybate significantly enhanced subjective sleep quality and objectively measured slow-wave sleep duration (+72.7 minutes; 95% CI, 55.7 to 89.7 minutes; P < .001). Differences were more pronounced in the per-protocol analysis. Sodium oxybate was generally well tolerated under dose adjustments (no treatment-related dropouts), but it induced de novo obstructive sleep apnea in 2 patients and parasomnia in 1 patient, as detected by polysomnography, all of whom did not benefit from sodium oxybate treatment.
This study provides class I evidence for the efficacy of sodium oxybate in treating EDS and nocturnal sleep disturbance in patients with PD. Special monitoring with follow-up polysomnography is necessary to rule out treatment-related complications and larger follow-up trials with longer treatment durations are warranted for validation.
